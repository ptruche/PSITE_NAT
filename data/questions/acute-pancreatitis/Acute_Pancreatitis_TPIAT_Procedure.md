id: PANCREATITIS-028
A: Total pancreatectomy with immediate islet cell isolation and autotransplantation into the portal vein, preserving pylorus and duodenum when feasible
B: Partial distal pancreatectomy followed by intraperitoneal injection of exocrine tissue to restore function
C: Total pancreatectomy with exogenous insulin replacement, as islet autotransplantation is contraindicated in children
D: Drainage procedure with Roux-en-Y jejunal limb to pancreas to promote islet regeneration
E: Partial resection of the head of the pancreas with islet cell biopsy only
correct: A

A 13-year-old girl with hereditary chronic pancreatitis presents with debilitating pain and repeated hospitalizations despite prior ductal drainage and partial resection. She is scheduled for total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT).  

Which of the following best describes the procedure and its rationale?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT)** is indicated for **pediatric patients with chronic pancreatitis** who have **persistent pain** and **ductal pathology** not relieved by prior drainage or partial resection procedures. The goal is to **eliminate the source of pain** while preserving **endocrine function** via islet autotransplantation.

**1. Indications:**  
- Chronic pancreatitis refractory to medical or surgical management.  
- Recurrent pain leading to poor quality of life or narcotic dependence.  
- Pediatric patients with **genetic pancreatitis (e.g., PRSS1 mutations)** or severe ductal disease.  

**2. Operative steps:**  
1. **Midline laparotomy** with exposure of the pancreas.  
2. Mobilize the **colon**, perform a **Kocher maneuver**, and divide the **short gastric vessels**.  
3. Isolate the **gastroduodenal artery** and **portal triad**.  
4. Mobilize the **pancreas from left to right** off the **splenic and superior mesenteric veins** while maintaining perfusion as long as possible to minimize **warm ischemia**.  
5. **Transect the duodenum** 3 cm distal to the pylorus and at the **ligament of Treitz**; preserve the pylorus.  
6. Transect the **bile duct** at the superior border of the pancreas.  
7. Divide the **splenic artery, vein, and gastroduodenal artery**, then remove the pancreas.  
8. The excised pancreas is processed immediately for **islet isolation** and **preservation**.  
9. Construct a **choledochojejunostomy** and **Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy**, followed by **Stamm gastrojejunostomy** for access.  
10. **Infuse islet cells** into the **portal vein** to engraft in the liver.  

**3. Outcomes:**  
- In pediatric series, **~90% experience significant pain relief**, and **~40% achieve insulin independence**.  
- **Better outcomes** associated with **higher islet equivalents/kg**, **male sex**, and **smaller body surface area**.  

| Step | Key Detail | Purpose |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Pancreatectomy** | Entire pancreas removed | Pain source eliminated |
| **Islet isolation** | From resected pancreas | Preserve endocrine function |
| **Portal infusion** | Islets delivered to liver | Glucose regulation |
| **Roux-en-Y reconstruction** | Restore biliary & gastric continuity | GI continuity |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Exocrine tissue has no functional benefit.  
- **C:** Islet autotransplantation is specifically indicated to preserve endocrine function.  
- **D:** Drainage does not prevent recurrence or preserve islet mass.  
- **E:** Partial resection is inadequate for diffuse disease.  

**Key takeaway:** **TP-IAT** offers durable pain relief and potential **insulin independence** in children with refractory chronic pancreatitis, combining **total pancreatectomy** with **autologous islet transplantation** into the liver.

Correct answer: A — Total pancreatectomy with immediate islet cell isolation and autotransplantation into the portal vein, preserving pylorus and duodenum when feasible.
