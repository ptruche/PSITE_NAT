A 7-year-old boy undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia develops sudden abdominal pain and elevated lipase. Imaging shows diffuse pancreatic edema without necrosis. He is receiving L-asparaginase as part of his regimen.  

Which of the following best describes the mechanism of his pancreatitis?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**L-asparaginase** is a **well-recognized cause of acute pancreatitis** in pediatric oncology patients.  
The drug depletes **asparagine**, an amino acid required by rapidly dividing cells—including pancreatic acinar cells—leading to **cellular injury**, **ductal inflammation**, and **enzyme leakage**.

**Key features:**  
- Incidence: ~5–10% in children receiving L-asparaginase.  
- Onset: Usually within days to weeks of initiation.  
- Presentation: Abdominal pain, elevated amylase/lipase, may require discontinuation of therapy.  
- **Rechallenge risk:** 50% recurrence; drug should be **permanently discontinued**.  

**Other notable drug causes:**  
- **Valproic acid** – mitochondrial toxicity (not triglyceride mediated).  
- **Azathioprine, tetracycline, corticosteroids, pentamidine, metronidazole** – rare idiosyncratic injury.  

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Valproic acid causes pancreatitis through direct toxicity, not hypertriglyceridemia.  
- **C:** Metronidazole-induced pancreatitis is rare and not from mucosal toxicity.  
- **D:** Steroid-induced pancreatitis is idiosyncratic, not withdrawal-related.  
- **E:** Acetaminophen causes hepatic, not pancreatic, injury.

**Key takeaway:**  
**L-asparaginase** causes **acute pancreatitis** through **acinar cell toxicity**, a complication pediatric surgeons must recognize when consulted for children on leukemia protocols.

Correct answer: A — L-asparaginase–induced pancreatic injury causing ductal inflammation and enzyme elevation.
