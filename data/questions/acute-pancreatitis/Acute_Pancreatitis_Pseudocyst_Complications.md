A 12-year-old boy undergoes endoscopic cystgastrostomy for a symptomatic pancreatic pseudocyst that developed after blunt abdominal trauma. Two weeks later, he presents with mild abdominal pain and low-grade fever. CT shows a small peripancreatic fluid collection and no free air.  

Which of the following lists the major complications that may occur after pseudocyst drainage?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The principal complications following **pseudocyst drainage**—whether endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical—include **leak or perforation, infection, hemorrhage, postprocedure pancreatitis, and recurrence**. These complications result from either **technical failure**, **incomplete drainage**, or **ongoing pancreatic disease**.

**1. Leak or perforation:**  
- May occur **immediately after drainage** or **during stent exchange**.  
- **Small leaks** can often be managed **conservatively** with bowel rest and drainage.  
- **Large leaks** or those associated with peritonitis require **surgical exploration** or additional drainage.  
- The presence of a **mature cyst wall** (≥4–6 weeks old) reduces leak risk.

**2. Infection:**  
- May develop due to **incomplete drainage** or **iatrogenic contamination**.  
- Managed with **antibiotics** and **drainage** (endoscopic or percutaneous).

**3. Hemorrhage:**  
- Can be mild or severe, and occurs when the pseudocyst **erodes into nearby vessels**.  
- Most commonly involves the **gastroduodenal**, **pancreaticoduodenal**, or **splenic artery**.  
- Severe cases may form a **pseudoaneurysm**, which can rupture.  
- **Endoscopic cautery** and **meticulous surgical hemostasis** are critical to prevent this.

| Vessel Affected | Clinical Context | Management |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Gastroduodenal artery | Necrotizing pancreatitis | Angioembolization |
| Splenic artery | Tail pseudocyst | Embolization or splenectomy |
| Pancreaticoduodenal arteries | Head pseudocyst | Endoscopic/surgical repair |

**4. Postprocedure pancreatitis:**  
- Seen in **5–10%** of patients, typically mild.  
- Due to ductal trauma, instrumentation, or stent obstruction.

**5. Incomplete drainage or recurrence:**  
- Occurs in **8–10%** of cases, more common after endoscopic procedures.  
- Causes: **ongoing pancreatic inflammation**, **stent obstruction**, or **ductal strictures**.  
- Open procedures have lower recurrence but higher morbidity.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Biliary strictures and ulcers are rare and not typical.  
- **C:** Malabsorption occurs in chronic pancreatitis, not as a drainage complication.  
- **D:** Splenic infarction and bowel perforation are rare, not leading complications.  
- **E:** Endocrine insufficiency is uncommon unless a major portion of the pancreas is resected.

**Key takeaway:** The major complications of pseudocyst drainage include **leak/perforation, infection, hemorrhage (pseudoaneurysm), postprocedure pancreatitis, and recurrence**, with risk minimized by delaying intervention until a mature cyst wall forms.

Correct answer: A — Hemorrhage, leak, infection, recurrent pseudocyst, and postprocedure pancreatitis are the most common complications after pseudocyst drainage.
