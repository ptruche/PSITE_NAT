id: PANCREATITIS-012
A: Abdominal ultrasound as the first-line study, with CT reserved for complicated or uncertain cases
B: Immediate CT abdomen with IV contrast for all suspected cases to confirm diagnosis
C: Routine abdominal radiograph as the definitive imaging study for pancreatitis
D: MRI/MRCP as the initial study for every child with abdominal pain
E: Endoscopic ultrasound as first-line imaging to assess for pancreatic necrosis
correct: A

An 11-year-old boy presents with 2 days of epigastric pain radiating to his back, associated with nausea and vomiting. He is afebrile, mildly tachycardic, and has a tender upper abdomen without peritoneal signs. Serum lipase is 10× the upper limit of normal. The clinician suspects acute pancreatitis but wants to confirm the diagnosis and evaluate for a possible cause.  

Which of the following represents the most appropriate **initial imaging approach** in this child?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Imaging in pediatric acute pancreatitis** is guided by the **clinical context** and **differential diagnosis**, rather than routine use of a single modality. The goal is to confirm inflammation, identify complications, and evaluate for underlying causes such as gallstones or trauma.

**1. Ultrasound (first-line):**  
- Noninvasive, no radiation.  
- Can detect **pancreatic swelling**, **peripancreatic fluid**, **ductal dilation**, or **gallstones**.  
- Limitations: reduced sensitivity (~70%) due to **bowel gas, obesity, or ascites**.  
- Preferred **initial imaging study** in children.

**2. Computed Tomography (CT):**  
- Sensitivity ~95%.  
- Indicated for **severe, traumatic, or uncertain cases**, or to evaluate complications (necrosis, hemorrhage, pseudocyst, abscess).  
- Also used for **intervention guidance** (drainage, embolization).  
- Not required for mild, straightforward cases due to radiation exposure.

**3. Plain abdominal radiograph:**  
- Nonspecific findings: **sentinel loop**, **colon cutoff sign**, **calcified gallstones**, or **left pleural effusion**.  
- Used only to rule out other causes of abdominal pain (e.g., perforation).  

**4. MRI/MRCP:**  
- Used when CT contraindicated or when detailed **ductal anatomy** is required (e.g., pancreaticobiliary malunion, divisum).  

| Imaging Modality | Key Role | Pediatric Considerations |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Plain film** | Rule out perforation; nonspecific signs | Low sensitivity |
| **Ultrasound** | First-line; detects inflammation, gallstones | No radiation |
| **CT (contrast)** | Defines necrosis/collections; trauma evaluation | Radiation risk |
| **MRCP** | Best for ductal anomalies | Requires sedation in young children |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** CT is not indicated for all cases—reserved for complications or uncertain diagnosis.  
- **C:** Abdominal x-ray is nonspecific, not diagnostic.  
- **D:** MRI is not first-line; reserved for ductal or recurrent disease.  
- **E:** Endoscopic ultrasound is invasive and not first-line in children.  

**Key takeaway:** In pediatric acute pancreatitis, **ultrasound** is the **first-line imaging modality**, with **CT or MRCP reserved for severe, uncertain, or complicated cases**.

Correct answer: A — Abdominal ultrasound is first-line; CT or MRCP are second-line for complex or unclear cases.
