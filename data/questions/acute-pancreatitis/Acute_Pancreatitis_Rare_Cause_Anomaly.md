E: Celiac disease–associated duodenal inflammation
correct: A

A 6-year-old girl presents with her third episode of acute pancreatitis in 8 months. Ultrasound and CT show a mildly dilated pancreatic duct and common bile duct with no stones. MRCP demonstrates a long common channel between the bile and pancreatic ducts above the duodenal wall.  

Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this condition?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

This patient has a **pancreaticobiliary malunion (PBM)**, a **congenital structural anomaly** in which the **bile and pancreatic ducts join outside the duodenal wall**, creating an **abnormally long common channel**.  
This configuration allows **reflux of bile into the pancreatic duct**, leading to **recurrent episodes of pancreatitis**.

**Key features:**  
- Common channel located **proximal to the sphincter of Oddi**.  
- Associated with **choledochal cysts**.  
- Predisposes to **pancreatitis, cholangitis, and biliary carcinoma** (in older patients).  
- Diagnosis: **MRCP or ERCP** showing long common channel.  
- **Treatment:** Surgical excision of the **extrahepatic bile duct** with **Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy**.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Sludge alone doesn’t explain recurrent ductal reflux.  
- **C:** Biliary atresia causes neonatal cholestasis, not recurrent pancreatitis.  
- **D:** Tail trauma causes isolated injury, not recurrent disease.  
- **E:** Celiac disease may cause mild enzyme elevation, not true pancreatitis.

**Key takeaway:**  
**Pancreaticobiliary malunion** allows **reflux between bile and pancreatic ducts**, leading to **recurrent acute pancreatitis** in children.

Correct answer: A — Pancreaticobiliary malunion causing reflux of bile into the pancreatic duct.
