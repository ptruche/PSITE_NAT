id: PANCREATITIS-035
A: PRSS1 mutation leading to abnormal trypsin activation and hereditary pancreatitis
B: SPINK1 mutation causing defective calcium transport and exocrine insufficiency
C: CFTR mutation causing exocrine insufficiency without pancreatitis risk
D: CTRC mutation leading to excessive protease degradation and ductal obstruction
E: CASR mutation leading to hypercalcemia but not pancreatitis
correct: A

A 10-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of pancreatitis since age 6. There is a strong family history of similar episodes in multiple generations. Genetic testing reveals a gain-of-function mutation in the cationic trypsinogen gene (PRSS1).  

Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of pancreatitis in this patient?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **PRSS1 gene** encodes **cationic trypsinogen**.  
Mutations in PRSS1 cause **autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis** through **premature intrapancreatic activation of trypsinogen to trypsin**, leading to **self-digestion** and **recurrent pancreatitis**.

**Key points:**  
- **Autosomal dominant inheritance** with variable penetrance.  
- Patients often present in **childhood** with **recurrent pancreatitis** that progresses to **chronic pancreatitis**.  
- Associated with **increased lifetime risk of pancreatic cancer**.  
- **Other genetic causes:**  
  - **SPINK1:** Inhibitor deficiency → loss of trypsin control.  
  - **CFTR:** Ductal secretion defect → thick secretions and obstruction.  
  - **CTRC:** Abnormal protease degradation.  
  - **CASR:** Hypercalcemia-related pancreatitis.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** SPINK1 mutation affects trypsin inhibition, not calcium transport.  
- **C:** CFTR mutations increase, not decrease, pancreatitis risk.  
- **D:** CTRC mutations impair degradation but are less penetrant.  
- **E:** CASR mutation can contribute but via hypercalcemia-induced ductal activation, not absence of pancreatitis.

**Key takeaway:**  
**PRSS1 mutations** cause **autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis** via **premature trypsin activation**, leading to recurrent acute and chronic pancreatitis.

Correct answer: A — PRSS1 mutation leading to abnormal trypsin activation and hereditary pancreatitis.
