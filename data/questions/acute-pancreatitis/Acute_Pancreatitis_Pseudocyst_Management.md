id: PANCREATITIS-020
A: Observation, as most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously within six weeks
B: Immediate percutaneous drainage to prevent hemorrhage or infection
C: Empiric antibiotics to prevent secondary infection
D: Urgent surgical cystgastrostomy for all pseudocysts larger than 5 cm
E: Early ERCP to evaluate ductal anatomy and guide drainage
correct: A

A 10-year-old boy presents two weeks after a blunt abdominal trauma sustained in a bicycle accident. He now has mild epigastric fullness and early satiety but is otherwise well. CT scan shows a 4.5 cm well-circumscribed fluid collection adjacent to the pancreas, consistent with a pseudocyst. His labs are normal and he has no signs of infection, bleeding, or obstruction.  

What is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Pancreatic pseudocysts** are **nonepithelial fluid collections** containing **high-amylase pancreatic secretions**, typically forming after pancreatic injury or inflammation. The fluid is often **clear to yellow** with **amylase levels >50,000 U/L**.

**1. Pathophysiology and natural history:**  
- Develop within **days to weeks** after pancreatic injury (trauma or inflammation).  
- Most **resolve spontaneously** within **six weeks** of the initial insult.  
- **Traumatic pseudocysts** have a higher rate of spontaneous resolution compared with nontraumatic ones.  

**2. Management approach:**  
- **Asymptomatic pseudocysts**: Observation and supportive care. Spontaneous resolution is common if there is no ductal obstruction.  
- **Symptomatic pseudocysts**: Intervention may be indicated for persistent pain, gastric outlet obstruction, infection, bleeding, or rupture.  
- **Mediastinal extension** can cause **dyspnea, chest pain, or pleural effusion**, but these too can sometimes resolve conservatively.  

**3. Interventions (only for complicated cases):**  
- **Endoscopic drainage**, **percutaneous drainage**, or **surgical cystgastrostomy** reserved for:  
  - Persistent symptoms  
  - Infection (fever, leukocytosis, gas in cyst)  
  - Hemorrhage (GI bleeding, rapid size increase)  
  - Ductal obstruction causing jaundice or vomiting  

| Type | Description | Management |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| **Asymptomatic, small (<6 cm)** | Often post-traumatic | Observation |
| **Symptomatic or large (>6 cm)** | Persistent >6 weeks | Drainage (endoscopic/surgical) |
| **Infected or hemorrhagic** | Rare | Drainage + antibiotics / embolization |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Prophylactic drainage is unnecessary and increases infection risk.  
- **C:** Antibiotics are not indicated unless infection is proven.  
- **D:** Routine cystgastrostomy is not indicated for size alone.  
- **E:** ERCP is reserved for complex or recurrent cases, not initial management.  

**Key takeaway:** Most **pediatric pancreatic pseudocysts**—especially **post-traumatic and asymptomatic** ones—resolve spontaneously within **six weeks**; intervention is reserved for symptomatic or complicated lesions.

Correct answer: A — Observation, as most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously within six weeks.
