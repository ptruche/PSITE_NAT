id: PANCREATITIS-017
A: Early enteral nutrition via gastric or postduodenal route as tolerated
B: Total parenteral nutrition to rest the pancreas until enzyme levels normalize
C: Prolonged NPO with nasogastric decompression for 5–7 days
D: Delayed feeding until pain completely resolves and imaging shows improvement
E: Routine use of elemental formulas delivered jejunally for all cases
correct: A

A 10-year-old boy with moderate acute pancreatitis is admitted for management. He is hydrated and his pain is improving. Historically, patients were kept NPO for several days to allow pancreatic “rest.” However, current evidence has changed this approach.  

Which of the following best reflects the optimal nutritional strategy for this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Historically, the pancreas was “rested” by **prolonged fasting and parenteral nutrition**, but multiple **meta-analyses in adults** have shown that **early enteral feeding** improves outcomes, reduces infectious complications, and shortens hospital stay. Although **pediatric-specific data** are limited, the same principles apply.

**1. Early enteral feeding:**  
- Should begin **within 24–48 hours** of admission, as soon as tolerated.  
- Reduces **bacterial translocation** and **infectious complications**.  
- Associated with lower **mortality** and **organ failure** compared with parenteral nutrition.  
- Can be delivered **orally, nasogastrically, or postduodenally**—the route is less important than the timing.

**2. Parenteral nutrition:**  
- Reserved for patients who **cannot tolerate enteral intake** due to ileus, obstruction, or persistent vomiting.  
- Carries higher risks of **infection, hyperglycemia, and line-related complications.**

**3. Pancreatic “rest” is outdated.**  
- Enteral feeding does not exacerbate inflammation and actually helps maintain **gut integrity**.  
- “Resting” the pancreas by fasting delays recovery and worsens outcomes.

| Feeding Approach | Timing | Outcome Impact | Comments |
|------------------|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **Early enteral (oral, NG, or NJ)** | Within 24–48 h | ↓ mortality, ↓ infection, ↓ organ failure | Preferred method |
| **Delayed feeding** | After several days NPO | ↑ infection, ↑ LOS | Not recommended |
| **Parenteral nutrition** | When enteral not tolerated | ↑ complications | Secondary option |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** TPN increases complications and offers no benefit over enteral feeding.  
- **C:** Routine bowel rest delays recovery.  
- **D:** Delayed feeding worsens outcomes.  
- **E:** Elemental jejunal feeding is not required in mild/moderate disease.  

**Key takeaway:** **Early enteral feeding**—by mouth, nasogastric, or postduodenal routes—is **safe, feasible, and improves outcomes** in pancreatitis; “pancreatic rest” via prolonged fasting is no longer recommended.

Correct answer: A — Early enteral nutrition via gastric or postduodenal route as tolerated.
