A 14-year-old boy with chronic pancreatitis and a markedly dilated pancreatic duct presents with severe recurrent pain. Imaging reveals ductal dilation extending into the head of the pancreas with multiple intraductal stones. The team decides to perform a Frey procedure.  

Which of the following best describes the key steps and principles of this operation?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **Frey procedure** combines **limited resection of the pancreatic head** with a **longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy**, designed to **decompress the entire pancreatic ductal system** and **relieve pain** while preserving duodenal continuity.

**1. Indications:**  
- Chronic pancreatitis with **inflammatory enlargement of the pancreatic head** and **dilated pancreatic duct**.  
- Recurrent pain despite medical and endoscopic management.  
- Ductal obstruction or stone burden concentrated in the pancreatic head.

**2. Operative steps:**  
1. Make a **subcostal or midline incision** and expose the pancreas by opening the **lesser sac**.  
2. **Identify and open the pancreatic duct** longitudinally along its entire length.  
3. **Resect the anterior portion of the pancreatic head**, excising enough tissue to **expose the posterior and medial walls of the ducts**.  
   - The **posterior wall of the main duct** defines the **posterior extent** of the resection.  
   - Leave approximately **0.5 cm of tissue** at the posterior margin for anastomosis.  
4. Remove **intraductal stones** and **debride inflammatory tissue**.  
5. Create a **Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum** and perform a **side-to-side pancreaticojejunostomy** along the opened duct and resected head cavity.  
6. Anastomose using **mucosa-to-mucosa sutures** for full drainage of both head and duct.  

**3. Comparison with related procedures:**  
- **DuVal procedure:** Distal pancreatectomy with caudal pancreaticojejunostomy (rare).  
- **Beger procedure:** Duodenal-preserving pancreatic head resection with Roux-en-Y reconstruction to both head cavity and tail.  
- The **Frey procedure** preserves the duodenum and allows full drainage with **less morbidity** than a Beger resection.

| Procedure | Key Feature | Anastomosis Type |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Frey** | Anterior head resection + longitudinal PJ | Single PJ to entire duct |
| **Beger** | Duodenal-preserving head resection | Two PJ anastomoses (head + tail) |
| **DuVal** | Distal resection + tail PJ | Single caudal PJ |

**4. Pediatric outcomes:**  
- Data limited due to rarity.  
- Selected cases show **good pain relief** and **preservation of endocrine function**.  
- Procedure choice depends on **ductal anatomy** and **disease localization**.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Refers to total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation, not a drainage procedure.  
- **C:** Describes the DuVal operation, not the Frey.  
- **D:** Describes the Beger procedure, which uses two anastomoses.  
- **E:** Endoscopic therapy does not address head disease requiring resection.  

**Key takeaway:** The **Frey procedure** involves **anterior pancreatic head resection with longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy**, providing complete ductal drainage while preserving duodenal anatomy and minimizing morbidity.

Correct answer: A — Local resection of the pancreatic head combined with longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy to ensure complete ductal drainage.
