A: Calcium channel blockers provide long-term cure in most pediatric patients
B: Pneumatic dilation is an effective first-line therapy in children older than eight years
C: Botulinum toxin injection provides permanent resolution in over 80% of patients
D: Medical therapy with nitrates and calcium channel blockers is curative in most cases
E: Pharmacologic agents increase LES tone to improve esophageal emptying
correct: B

A 12-year-old child is diagnosed with achalasia after high-resolution manometry confirms absent peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The family prefers to avoid surgery if possible. Which of the following is the most effective non-surgical treatment option for this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

Medical and endoscopic therapies for **achalasia** aim to **reduce LES pressure**, improving esophageal emptying and symptom relief. While definitive management in children often requires **surgical or endoscopic intervention**, several nonsurgical options exist with varying degrees of success.

| Therapy | Mechanism | Efficacy / Notes |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine)** | Decrease smooth muscle tone and LES pressure | Effective in adults; *limited and transient effect in children* |
| **Nitrates (e.g., isosorbide dinitrate)** | NO-mediated smooth muscle relaxation of LES | Used as palliative therapy; short duration of action |
| **Botulinum toxin injection (Botox®)** | Inhibits acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junction, reducing LES tone | Short-term benefit (≈4 months); only 10–40% have lasting relief; repeat injections often required |
| **Pneumatic dilation** | Radial stretching and disruption of LES muscle fibers | *Most effective nonsurgical treatment in children ≥8 years*; may require multiple sessions; good short-term safety profile |

**Pneumatic dilation** is the **most effective non-surgical option** for children, particularly those older than 8 years. A 35 mm balloon is typically used, with repeated dilations as needed. It offers rapid symptom relief, short recovery time, and low cost. However, long-term durability remains uncertain, and recurrence may occur, requiring repeat dilation or eventual myotomy.

**Botulinum toxin injection** provides transient relief and may be used in **poor surgical candidates** or as a **bridge therapy**.  
**Medical agents** (calcium channel blockers and nitrates) are of *limited benefit* in pediatric patients and rarely used as standalone therapy.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Goal:** Reduce LES pressure and improve esophageal emptying.  
- **Most effective nonsurgical therapy:** Pneumatic dilation.  
- **Botulinum toxin:** Short-lived, useful in select cases.  
- **Pharmacologic therapy:** Palliative only; not curative.  

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Calcium channel blockers offer temporary benefit, not long-term cure.  
- **C:** Botox rarely provides permanent relief; success ≤40%.  
- **D:** Medical therapy alone is not curative in children.  
- **E:** Treatment *decreases*, not increases, LES tone.

Correct answer: B — Pneumatic dilation is an effective first-line therapy in children older than eight years.
