id: ACHALASIA-PREOP-PREPARATION-009
A: No special preoperative preparation is required beyond standard NPO guidelines
B: Patients should be kept NPO for 8 hours prior to surgery and administered antifungal therapy postoperatively only
C: Clear liquid diet for several days before surgery reduces aspiration risk from retained esophageal contents
D: Routine nasogastric decompression before induction is sufficient to prevent aspiration
E: Dexamethasone is contraindicated during POEM due to mucosal edema risk
correct: C

A 12-year-old child is scheduled for a laparoscopic Heller myotomy after being diagnosed with achalasia. During the preoperative assessment, the anesthesia team expresses concern about aspiration risk at induction. Which of the following preoperative measures is most appropriate for this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Preoperative preparation for achalasia** focuses on minimizing **aspiration risk** and **optimizing esophageal visualization** during surgery or endoscopic myotomy. Because patients often have retained food in the esophagus due to poor clearance, thoughtful preparation is essential.

### Key Preoperative Measures

| Consideration | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Diet** | **Clear liquid diet for 1–5 days before surgery** | Reduces retained esophageal contents and aspiration risk during induction |
| **Aspiration risk** | Anesthesia team should anticipate **full stomach** physiology | Retained esophageal contents may reflux during induction |
| **Candida prophylaxis** | **Nystatin swish and swallow for 3–5 days** preoperatively | Treats *Candida esophagitis* often present in patients with food stasis, improving mucosal visualization |
| **Anti-inflammatory support (POEM)** | **Single dose dexamethasone at induction** | Decreases mucosal edema, facilitating safe closure of mucosotomy |
| **Standard fasting guidelines** | Still applied in conjunction with clear-liquid preparation | Prevents gastric aspiration |

### Anesthetic Implications
- **High aspiration risk** due to food retention; **rapid sequence induction** may be warranted.  
- **Endotracheal intubation** with cuffed tube is essential.  
- **Positioning** (head-up or reverse Trendelenburg) helps reduce regurgitation risk.  

**Special Note for POEM:**  
During peroral endoscopic myotomy, *dexamethasone* at induction minimizes mucosal swelling and facilitates mucosotomy closure—contrary to being contraindicated.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Clear liquids for several days reduce retained contents and aspiration risk.  
- Nystatin pre-treatment enhances endoscopic visualization.  
- Dexamethasone aids mucosal healing and is beneficial in POEM.  
- Close coordination with anesthesia is critical for airway safety.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Standard NPO alone is insufficient; retained food is common even after fasting.  
- **B:** Antifungal therapy is given preoperatively, not just postoperatively.  
- **D:** Nasogastric decompression cannot clear solid or thick contents in achalasia.  
- **E:** Dexamethasone *reduces*, not worsens, mucosal edema in POEM.

Correct answer: C — Clear liquid diet for several days before surgery reduces aspiration risk from retained esophageal contents.
