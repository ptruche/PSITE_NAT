id: ACHALASIA-HELLER-MYOTOMY-011
A: Myotomy is performed on the posterior aspect of the esophagus to avoid the anterior vagus nerve
B: The myotomy extends 2–3 cm on the esophagus and 5–7 cm onto the stomach
C: The myotomy is performed to the right of the anterior vagus nerve and extends 5–7 cm on the esophagus and 2–4 cm onto the stomach
D: The submucosa is intentionally cauterized to prevent postoperative bleeding
E: The Dor fundoplication should be wrapped tightly to prevent reflux
correct: C

A 6-year-old child is undergoing laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. The surgeon identifies the anterior vagal nerve and plans the incision to the right of it. The circular muscle layer is divided using hook cautery, and the submucosal plane is entered. Endoscopy confirms adequate relaxation of the esophagogastric junction. Which of the following best describes the correct surgical technique for this procedure?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM)** is the **standard surgical approach** for definitive treatment of achalasia. The procedure involves **longitudinal division of the esophageal and gastric circular muscle fibers** to relieve lower esophageal sphincter (LES) obstruction while preserving mucosal integrity.

### Key Steps in Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy

| Step | Description | Technical Detail |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **1. Positioning and setup** | Supine with arms tucked; standard fundoplication setup | 4 × 5 mm trocars + 1 × 10–12 mm umbilical trocar; 30° scope |
| **2. Exposure** | Elevate left lobe of liver | Use Nathanson liver retractor; divide gastrohepatic and phrenoesophageal ligaments |
| **3. Identification** | Anterior vagus nerve visualized | Myotomy performed **to the right** of the nerve |
| **4. Myotomy incision** | Score serosa along anterior esophagus | Hook cautery, 5–7 cm on esophagus and 2–4 cm on stomach |
| **5. Muscle division** | Separate longitudinal, then circular muscle | Expose submucosa; **avoid cautery on gastric side vessels**—use tamponade for bleeding |
| **6. Endoscopic assessment** | Confirm complete EGJ opening | Flexible endoscopy before closure |
| **7. Fundoplication** | **Partial anterior (Dor)** fundoplication | Attach fundus to edges of myotomy with 2–3 sutures per side; avoid tension or twist |

### Technical Pearls
- **Posterior dissection** is generally avoided to minimize postoperative reflux, unless performing a **Toupet fundoplication**.  
- **Avoid submucosal cautery** to prevent perforation; bleeding is managed with gentle pressure.  
- **Measure the myotomy** periodically to ensure adequate proximal and distal extent.  

### Intraoperative Adjuncts
- **Flexible endoscopy**: Guides myotomy placement and confirms mucosal integrity and EGJ opening.  
- **Bougie dilator (optional)**: Used when endoscope unavailable for luminal reference.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Myotomy: **5–7 cm on esophagus**, **2–4 cm on stomach**, **right of anterior vagus**.  
- Avoid posterior dissection unless performing Toupet fundoplication.  
- Dor fundoplication: **Loose, partial anterior wrap**—prevents reflux without causing obstruction.  

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Myotomy is anterior and right of vagus, not posterior.  
- **B:** Lengths reversed; main myotomy on esophagus, shorter on stomach.  
- **D:** Submucosal cauterization risks perforation.  
- **E:** Tight wraps cause dysphagia; should be tension-free.  

Correct answer: C — The myotomy is performed to the right of the anterior vagus nerve and extends 5–7 cm on the esophagus and 2–4 cm onto the stomach.
