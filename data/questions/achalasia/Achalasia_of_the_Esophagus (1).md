A 12-year-old boy presents with **progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids** and occasional regurgitation of undigested food. He denies odynophagia or weight loss. Barium swallow reveals a **dilated esophagus with distal tapering** resembling a “bird’s beak.” High-resolution manometry demonstrates **absence of peristalsis** in the distal esophagus, **increased resting LES pressure**, and **incomplete LES relaxation**.

Which of the following best describes the underlying disorder?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Explanation:**  
This patient’s presentation and diagnostic findings are classic for **primary (idiopathic) achalasia** — a rare **esophageal motility disorder** characterized by **three hallmark abnormalities**:

1. **Absence of peristalsis** in the distal esophagus  
2. **Elevated resting pressure** of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)  
3. **Incomplete or absent LES relaxation** with swallowing  

These abnormalities result from **degeneration of inhibitory neurons** (particularly nitric oxide–producing neurons) in the **myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus**, leading to unopposed cholinergic stimulation and impaired esophageal emptying. Over time, this causes **functional obstruction**, **esophageal dilation**, and **progressive dysphagia** that initially affects solids and later liquids.  

**Secondary achalasia**, or *pseudoachalasia*, can occur due to:  
- **Chagas disease** (*Trypanosoma cruzi* infection destroying myenteric neurons)  
- **Malignancy** at the gastroesophageal junction causing infiltration of the LES  
- **Neurologic injury** or autonomic dysfunction (e.g., spinal cord lesions)  

**Diagnostic Evaluation**  
| Test | Typical Findings |
|------|------------------|
| **Barium swallow** | Dilated esophagus with distal “bird’s beak” narrowing |
| **Manometry** | Aperistalsis, hypertensive LES, incomplete LES relaxation |
| **Endoscopy** | Normal mucosa, tight LES, used to exclude malignancy |

**Management Overview**  
Treatment aims to reduce LES pressure and improve esophageal emptying:  
- **Heller myotomy** (laparoscopic or robotic) ± **fundoplication** to prevent reflux  
- **POEM (Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy)** — endoscopic alternative  
- **Pneumatic dilation** or **botulinum toxin injection** for non-surgical candidates  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Achalasia = *failure of LES relaxation + high LES tone + absent peristalsis*  
- Primary = idiopathic; Secondary = due to defined pathology (e.g., Chagas)  
- **Manometry** is diagnostic gold standard  
- **Definitive therapy**: mechanical or surgical LES disruption (Heller or POEM)  

**Why the Other Options Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Diffuse esophageal spasm causes chest pain and preserved LES relaxation.  
- **B:** Scleroderma esophagus shows *low LES pressure* and *absent peristalsis* — opposite LES pattern.  
- **D:** GERD causes hypotensive LES, not failure to relax.  
- **E:** Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis affects the pylorus, not the esophagus, and presents in infants with projectile vomiting.  

**Correct answer: C — Idiopathic achalasia with absent peristalsis, hypertensive LES, and incomplete LES relaxation.**
