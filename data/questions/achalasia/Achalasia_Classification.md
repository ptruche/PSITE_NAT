id: ACHALASIA-CLASSIFICATION-003
A: Type I achalasia has the best treatment response due to preserved pressurization
B: Type II achalasia shows panesophageal pressurization and has the best therapeutic outcome
C: Type III achalasia is the most common subtype in children
D: Esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction shows absent peristalsis with normal LES relaxation
E: All types of achalasia demonstrate identical manometric findings
correct: B

A 14-year-old patient is diagnosed with achalasia following high-resolution esophageal manometry. The study shows a mean integrated relaxation pressure (IRP) >15 mmHg, absent peristalsis, and panesophageal pressurization greater than 30 mmHg in over 20% of swallows. Which of the following statements is true regarding this subtype of achalasia?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Achalasia** is classified based on **high-resolution manometry (HRM)** into three subtypes that differ in esophageal pressurization patterns, prevalence, and response to therapy.

| Type | HRM Features | Frequency | Treatment Response |
|------|---------------|------------|--------------------|
| **Type I (Classic)** | IRP >15 mmHg, absent peristalsis, minimal pressurization | ~20% | Poor |
| **Type II (with esophageal compression)** | IRP >15 mmHg, absent peristalsis, panesophageal pressurization >30 mmHg in ≥20% of swallows | ~70% | Best |
| **Type III (Spastic)** | IRP >15 mmHg, absent peristalsis, premature/spastic contractions in ≥20% of swallows | ~10% | Worst |

A **fourth entity**, **esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO)**, is characterized by **impaired LES relaxation with preserved or weak peristalsis**. Its significance is uncertain—some cases represent early achalasia, others transient phenomena that may resolve spontaneously.

**Clinical Implications:**  
- **Type II** is the most common subtype in children and adults and responds best to interventions such as pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy, or POEM.  
- **Type I** represents end-stage disease with an atonic esophagus and minimal pressurization.  
- **Type III** is rare, characterized by spastic, premature contractions and responds poorly to traditional therapies, sometimes requiring extended myotomy or POEM.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- High-resolution manometry distinguishes achalasia subtypes and guides prognosis.  
- **Type II has the best therapeutic response**, while **Type III is the most resistant.**  
- EGJOO represents a spectrum disorder and may progress to or resolve from early achalasia.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Type I has *poor* response to treatment.  
- **C:** Type II—not Type III—is most common in children.  
- **D:** EGJOO involves impaired LES relaxation, not normal relaxation.  
- **E:** Each subtype shows distinct manometric patterns.

Correct answer: B — Type II achalasia shows panesophageal pressurization and has the best therapeutic outcome.
