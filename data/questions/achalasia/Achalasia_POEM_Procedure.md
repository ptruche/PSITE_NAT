id: ACHALASIA-POEM-PROCEDURE-010
A: The mucosotomy is made 1–2 cm above the EGJ at the 6 o’clock position to access the submucosa
B: The submucosal tunnel is created proximal to the EGJ without crossing onto the gastric cardia
C: The mucosotomy is made 10–15 cm above the EGJ, the submucosal tunnel extends past the EGJ, and myotomy is carried 2–3 cm onto the gastric surface
D: The myotomy is performed within the mucosal layer using a snare cautery to avoid perforation
E: The mucosotomy is left open to allow postoperative drainage and prevent infection
correct: C

A 14-year-old patient with manometrically confirmed Type II achalasia is scheduled for peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM). During the operation, the surgeon marks the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and selects a mucosotomy site 12 cm proximally. After submucosal injection, a triangle-tip knife is used to create an entry point, and a submucosal tunnel is developed to the gastric side. Which of the following best describes the correct technique for performing POEM?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)** is a **minimally invasive, endoscopic treatment for achalasia** that involves creating a **submucosal tunnel** through which a **targeted myotomy** of the circular muscle layer of the esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter (LES) is performed. It restores LES relaxation while preserving mucosal integrity.

### Key Procedural Steps

| Step | Description | Key Technical Details |
|------|--------------|-----------------------|
| **1. Patient positioning and setup** | Supine, abdomen exposed | CO₂ insufflation, high-definition endoscopy (Olympus 180/190 series), ERBE VIO 300D generator |
| **2. Diagnostic evaluation** | Endoscopic inspection and measurement | Identify EGJ, measure distances for mucosotomy and myotomy |
| **3. Mucosotomy** | Entry point into submucosal plane | Created **10–15 cm above the EGJ** at **2 o’clock position** using **needle or triangle knife**; typically 1.5–2 cm incision |
| **4. Submucosal tunnel creation** | Dissect between submucosa and circular muscle | Extend **beyond EGJ** (onto gastric cardia) to ensure complete myotomy; use **ERBE 60 spray/effect 2** |
| **5. Myotomy** | Divide circular muscle fibers | Performed **within tunnel**, **5–7 cm in length**, extending **2–3 cm onto stomach** (ERBE 40 spray/effect 2) |
| **6. Closure** | Seal mucosotomy | Closed with **Resolution® clips** or **OverStitch® device** |

**Instruments commonly used:**
- Triangle-tip knife (Olympus KD‑640L) or needle knife (Boston Scientific M00545840)  
- Dissecting caps (hard or angled, Olympus)  
- Hemostatic graspers (Olympus FD‑411UR/LR)  
- CO₂ insufflation and flushing pump with methylene blue for visualization  

**Technical Rationale:**  
- **Creating the tunnel beyond the EGJ** ensures complete division of LES fibers and durable symptom relief.  
- **Maintaining mucosal integrity** prevents contamination of the mediastinum.  
- **Closure** is critical to prevent leakage and infection.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Mucosotomy: 10–15 cm above EGJ at 2 o’clock position.  
- Tunnel: Extends past EGJ onto gastric cardia.  
- Myotomy: 5–7 cm long, 2–3 cm into stomach.  
- Closure: Clips or OverStitch®.  

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Mucosotomy is too close to EGJ and in the wrong orientation.  
- **B:** Tunnel must cross the EGJ for adequate LES division.  
- **D:** Myotomy targets the *muscle layer*, not mucosa.  
- **E:** The mucosotomy must be securely closed to prevent leakage.

Correct answer: C — The mucosotomy is made 10–15 cm above the EGJ, the submucosal tunnel extends past the EGJ, and myotomy is carried 2–3 cm onto the gastric surface.
