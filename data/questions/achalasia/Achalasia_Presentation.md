A 10-year-old child presents with a 1-year history of difficulty swallowing solids that has progressed to liquids. The parents note regurgitation of undigested food and occasional nocturnal cough. The child has lost 4 kg over the past year and reports no pain with swallowing. Physical examination reveals mild malnutrition but is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following best describes the typical presentation of this condition?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Achalasia** classically presents with **progressive dysphagia**, first for *solids* and later for *liquids*, reflecting functional obstruction due to a **nonrelaxing lower esophageal sphincter (LES)**. The disorder develops insidiously over months to years, leading to characteristic symptoms and secondary complications.

| Symptom | Approximate Frequency | Mechanism |
|----------|----------------------|------------|
| **Dysphagia (69–75%)** | Most common presenting symptom | Failure of LES relaxation and loss of peristalsis |
| **Regurgitation (83%)** | Common, often nocturnal | Stasis of undigested food in dilated esophagus |
| **Vomiting (66–85%)** | May be misinterpreted as reflux | Food stasis, not gastric contents |
| **Weight loss / failure to thrive (64–76%)** | From poor intake and regurgitation | Nutritional deficiency |
| **Nocturnal cough (21–56%)** | Aspiration of retained food | Esophageal dilation and overflow |
| **Chest pain / choking / respiratory infections** | Variable | Esophageal distention and aspiration |

Because symptoms often mimic **gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)**, the diagnosis is frequently delayed for years. A high index of suspicion is needed, especially in children with **recurrent regurgitation without acid symptoms**.

**Allgrove (AAA) syndrome** should be considered in any child with achalasia plus **alacrima or adrenal insufficiency**, as it represents a syndromic, genetically linked variant (mutation in the *AAAS* gene encoding Aladin).

The **Eckardt Score** quantifies achalasia symptom severity using four components: dysphagia, regurgitation, chest pain, and weight loss.

| Score | Dysphagia | Regurgitation | Chest Pain | Weight Loss (kg) |
|--------|------------|----------------|-------------|------------------|
| **0** | None | None | None | None |
| **1** | Occasional | Occasional | Occasional | <5 |
| **2** | Daily | Daily | Daily | 5–10 |
| **3** | Each meal | Each meal | Each meal | >10 |

An **Eckardt score ≥3** generally indicates clinically significant disease requiring intervention (e.g., pneumatic dilation, Heller myotomy, or POEM).

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Progressive dysphagia (solids → liquids) and regurgitation of undigested food are hallmark symptoms.  
- Weight loss, nocturnal cough, and aspiration-related complications are common.  
- The Eckardt score provides a standardized way to measure severity and response to therapy.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Onset is insidious, not sudden, and odynophagia is uncommon.  
- **B:** Sequence reversed; starts with solids. Hematemesis is atypical.  
- **D:** Intermittent dysphagia with reflux is more typical of GERD or motility spasm.  
- **E:** Describes Plummer–Vinson syndrome, not achalasia.

Correct answer: C — Progressive dysphagia initially to solids then liquids, with regurgitation of undigested food and weight loss.
