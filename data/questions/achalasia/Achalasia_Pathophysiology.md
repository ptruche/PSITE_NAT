A: Loss of excitatory cholinergic neurons leading to a hypotonic lower esophageal sphincter
B: Unopposed inhibitory nitric oxide activity resulting in decreased LES tone and aperistalsis
C: Loss of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory ganglion cells leading to unopposed excitatory signaling and failure of LES relaxation
D: Fibrosis of the distal esophagus secondary to chronic reflux causing outflow obstruction
E: Impaired esophageal smooth muscle contractility due to myopathic degeneration
correct: C

A 15-year-old adolescent presents with progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids. High-resolution esophageal manometry reveals absent peristalsis and incomplete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Barium esophagram shows a dilated esophagus tapering to a “bird-beak” appearance. Which of the following best describes the pathophysiology underlying this disorder?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Achalasia** is characterized by *failure of LES relaxation* and *loss of organized peristalsis* in the esophageal body due to **loss of inhibitory neurons** in the **myenteric (Auerbach) plexus** of the distal esophagus.

The key defect is the **loss of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic (NANC) inhibitory ganglion cells**, which normally release **nitric oxide (NO)** and **vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)** to mediate LES relaxation. Their absence leads to **unopposed excitatory cholinergic and substance P activity**, resulting in **sustained LES contraction and failure to relax during swallowing.**

| Mechanism | Pathophysiologic Effect |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Loss of inhibitory neurons (NO, VIP) | Nonrelaxing LES, functional obstruction |
| Unopposed cholinergic activity | Increased LES pressure |
| Absent peristalsis | Stasis, regurgitation, progressive dilation |
| Chronic inflammation | T-cell, eosinophil, and mast cell infiltration of Auerbach plexus |

Over time, **stasis of food and secretions** causes **progressive esophageal dilation**, occasionally leading to a *sigmoid-shaped esophagus* in long-standing disease.  
Manometrically, achalasia can be classified into three subtypes based on esophageal pressurization patterns (Type I–III). These patterns may evolve over time, suggesting a continuum from **hypercontractile** to **aperistaltic** disease.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Achalasia results from **loss of inhibitory NANC neurons** (particularly NO-releasing neurons).  
- The **LES fails to relax** due to unopposed excitatory neurotransmission.  
- Chronic inflammation supports an *autoimmune-mediated neuronal loss.*

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Excitatory (not inhibitory) neurons are lost; LES becomes hypertonic, not hypotonic.  
- **B:** NO activity is reduced, not increased.  
- **D:** Fibrosis causes stricture, not achalasia.  
- **E:** Myopathic degeneration leads to ineffective motility, but LES relaxation is preserved.

Correct answer: C — Loss of nonadrenergic, noncholinergic inhibitory ganglion cells leading to unopposed excitatory signaling and failure of LES relaxation.
