A: Long-term symptom recurrence after Heller myotomy is rare, occurring in less than 5% of pediatric patients
B: Pneumatic dilation provides durable symptom relief in most children without the need for further intervention
C: Up to half of children experience recurrent symptoms after Heller myotomy, and reflux occurs in 5–15% of cases
D: Post-POEM reflux is uncommon and generally requires repeat surgery
E: Repeat myotomy is rarely needed after either POEM or Heller myotomy
correct: C

A 7-year-old patient underwent a laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia at age five. Two years later, the child presents with mild recurrent dysphagia but no weight loss. Which of the following best summarizes the long-term outcomes and expected complications for children treated surgically for achalasia?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Long-term outcomes** for children with achalasia are generally favorable in the short term but **less durable than in adults.** Recurrent symptoms and gastroesophageal reflux are the main late complications, regardless of treatment modality.

### Outcomes After Pneumatic Dilation
- **Initial relief** is common, but **recurrence occurs in nearly all children.**
- Repeated dilations may provide temporary benefit, but **definitive surgical myotomy** is usually required.
- Limited pediatric data and lack of long-term durability preclude its use as a sole therapy.

### Outcomes After Heller Myotomy
| Outcome | Incidence / Notes |
|----------|------------------|
| **Initial symptom relief** | Most patients improve postoperatively |
| **Recurrent dysphagia** | Occurs in up to **50%** of patients; often due to **incomplete gastric-side myotomy** or **growth-related changes** |
| **Gastroesophageal reflux** | Occurs in **5–15%**; usually controlled with medical therapy (PPI) |
| **Repeat intervention** | ~6% require **repeat myotomy**; others improve with **balloon dilation** |

### Outcomes After Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)
- **Short-term success**: Comparable to Heller myotomy.  
- **Long-term data in children**: Limited, but **recurrent dysphagia** can occur and may respond to repeat dilation or myotomy.  
- **Reflux symptoms**: Occur in up to **30%** of adults, though abnormal pH studies confirm true reflux in only half.  
- **Post-POEM reflux**: Typically mild and **responsive to medical therapy.**

### Comparative Data
- **POEM vs Heller Myotomy:** Adult studies (e.g., Swanstrom et al.) show **equivalent symptom control** and **reflux rates**, but **POEM offers shorter hospital stay** and faster recovery. Pediatric results are trending similarly.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Recurrence of dysphagia** is common in children (up to 50% after Heller).  
- **Reflux** occurs in a minority (5–15%) and is medically manageable.  
- **POEM** shows promising short-term outcomes, but long-term durability data in children remain limited.  
- **Repeat dilation or myotomy** may be needed in recurrent cases.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Recurrence rates are much higher (~50%), not <5%.  
- **B:** Pneumatic dilation relief is temporary in children.  
- **D:** Post-POEM reflux is common but controlled medically, not surgically.  
- **E:** Repeat procedures are occasionally required (~6% after Heller).

Correct answer: C — Up to half of children experience recurrent symptoms after Heller myotomy, and reflux occurs in 5–15% of cases.
