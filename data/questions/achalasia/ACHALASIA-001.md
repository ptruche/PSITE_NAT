A 12-year-old boy presents with **progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids** and occasional regurgitation of undigested food. He denies odynophagia or weight loss. Barium swallow reveals a **dilated esophagus with distal tapering** resembling a “bird’s beak.” High-resolution manometry demonstrates **absence of peristalsis** in the distal esophagus, **increased resting LES pressure**, and **incomplete LES relaxation**.

Which of the following best describes the underlying disorder?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->
**Explanation:**  
This patient’s presentation and diagnostic findings are classic for **primary (idiopathic) achalasia** — a rare **esophageal motility disorder** characterized by **three hallmark abnormalities**:

1. **Absence of peristalsis** in the distal esophagus  
2. **Elevated resting pressure** of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES)  
3. **Incomplete or absent LES relaxation** with swallowing  

These abnormalities reflect **degeneration of inhibitory neurons** (especially nitric oxide–producing neurons) in the **myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus**, leading to unopposed cholinergic stimulation of the LES and impaired peristaltic propagation. Over time, this causes **functional obstruction**, **esophageal dilation**, and **progressive dysphagia** that affects both solids and liquids.

**Secondary achalasia**, or pseudoachalasia, may occur in:  
- **Chagas disease** (infection by *Trypanosoma cruzi*, destroying myenteric neurons)  
- **Malignancy** at the gastroesophageal junction (infiltrating the LES)  
- **Spinal cord or vagal nerve injury**

### Diagnostic Findings
| Test | Typical Findings in Achalasia |
|------|-------------------------------|
| **Barium swallow** | Dilated esophagus, bird’s beak narrowing at LES |
| **Manometry** | Aperistalsis, high LES pressure, incomplete LES relaxation |
| **Endoscopy** | Normal mucosa, tight LES, used to exclude malignancy |

### Management Overview
Treatment aims to **reduce LES pressure** and **improve esophageal emptying**:

- **Pneumatic balloon dilation** (disrupts LES muscle fibers)  
- **Surgical Heller myotomy** (laparoscopic or open; often combined with fundoplication to prevent reflux)  
- **Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)** (minimally invasive endoscopic option)  
- **Botulinum toxin injection** (temporary, for poor surgical candidates)

---

### Key Takeaways
- **Primary achalasia** results from **loss of inhibitory myenteric neurons** → increased LES tone + failure of relaxation.  
- **Progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids** is the hallmark symptom.  
- **Manometry** is the gold standard for diagnosis.  
- **Definitive treatment** is mechanical or surgical disruption of the LES (Heller myotomy or POEM).  
- **Secondary causes** (Chagas, malignancy) must be ruled out with endoscopy.

### Why the Other Options Are Wrong
- **A. Diffuse esophageal spasm:** Presents with *chest pain* and *preserved LES relaxation*; peristalsis is uncoordinated but not absent.  
- **B. Scleroderma esophagus:** Involves *hypotensive LES* and *absent peristalsis* — opposite LES findings from achalasia.  
- **D. Secondary achalasia due to GERD:** GERD causes a *weak LES*, not failure to relax.  
- **E. Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis:** Affects the *pylorus*, not the esophagus, and presents with *projectile nonbilious vomiting* in infants.

**Correct answer: C — Idiopathic achalasia with absent peristalsis, hypertensive LES, and incomplete LES relaxation.**
