A 9-year-old child undergoes a laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. On postoperative day one, the patient is stable and without pain. Which of the following best describes the appropriate postoperative management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Postoperative care** after **Heller myotomy** or **peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)** focuses on early diet advancement, reflux prevention, and patient education about persistent esophageal motility limitations.

### Post–Heller Myotomy Care

| Aspect | Management | Rationale |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| **Diet** | Start **clear liquids on postoperative day 1**; advance as tolerated | Early diet is safe once leak risk is minimal |
| **Medications** | **Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)** and **analgesia** | Prevent reflux and control pain |
| **Discharge** | Typically within 1–2 days postoperatively | Minimally invasive recovery |
| **Follow-up** | Outpatient visit at 2 weeks; advance to regular diet if improved | Evaluate symptom resolution |
| **Long-term** | Gradual discontinuation of PPI over first few months | Continue reflux monitoring |

### Post–POEM Care

| Step | Timing | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|
| **NPO** | Immediately post-op until evaluation | Prevent leak-related complications |
| **Contrast esophagram (POD 1)** | Evaluate for **mucosotomy leak** into submucosal tunnel | Mandatory before starting oral intake |
| **Diet progression** | Start liquids if no leak, then gradual advancement | Mimics post-Heller pathway |
| **Medications** | PPI + acetaminophen for pain | Reflux prophylaxis and comfort |
| **Follow-up** | Clinic visit in ~2 weeks | Assess healing and diet tolerance |

### Patient Counseling
Patients should be counseled that despite LES division, **esophageal body motility remains impaired.** They should:  
- Eat **upright and slowly**.  
- **Chew thoroughly** and use liquids to assist swallowing.  
- Prefer **soft foods** as needed.  
- Report symptoms of **reflux or dysphagia recurrence** promptly.  

**Antireflux therapy** (PPI) is tapered off after a few months if no symptoms persist.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Begin liquids on **postoperative day 1** after Heller myotomy if stable.  
- Perform **contrast esophagram after POEM** before initiating oral intake.  
- Continue **PPI therapy short term** with careful monitoring for reflux.  
- Educate patients on long-term eating strategies due to persistent dysmotility.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Extended NPO is unnecessary; early feeding is safe.  
- **C:** Esophagram on POD 1 is routine after POEM, not optional.  
- **D:** PPIs should be tapered, not stopped abruptly.  
- **E:** Esophageal dysmotility persists—eating habits must be modified.

Correct answer: B — After Heller myotomy, patients begin a liquid diet on postoperative day one and transition to a regular diet if symptoms improve.
