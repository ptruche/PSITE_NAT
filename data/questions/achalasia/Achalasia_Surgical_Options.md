A: Thoracoscopic Heller myotomy with full fundoplication is standard of care
B: Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is the most common and definitive treatment
C: Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is contraindicated in pediatric patients due to high complication rates
D: Self-expanding esophageal stents are the preferred salvage therapy after failed myotomy
E: Partial esophagectomy is first-line surgical management for pediatric achalasia
correct: B

A 10-year-old patient with manometrically confirmed achalasia has failed pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection. The surgical team discusses treatment options with the family. Which of the following represents the current standard and most commonly performed surgical approach for achalasia in children?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Surgery** provides the most definitive and durable treatment for **achalasia**, especially in children. The goal is to **disrupt the hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES)** while minimizing postoperative gastroesophageal reflux.

| Surgical Option | Approach | Fundoplication | Comments |
|------------------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Laparoscopic Heller myotomy (LHM)** | Abdominal, minimally invasive | Usually **partial (Dor or Toupet)** | **Standard of care**; excellent long-term results |
| **Thoracoscopic Heller myotomy** | Thoracic | Often **no fundoplication** | Used in select cases; higher reflux risk |
| **Peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)** | Endoscopic submucosal tunneling | **None** | Increasingly popular; promising early results in pediatrics |
| **Self-expanding stents** | Endoscopic | None | Temporary palliation; not recommended routinely |
| **Esophagectomy / Replacement** | Open | N/A | Reserved for end-stage, failed cases |

### Laparoscopic Heller Myotomy (LHM)
- First performed by **Ernst Heller (1913)** via thoracotomy; now routinely done laparoscopically.  
- Involves **longitudinal myotomy** of LES fibers, typically **6 cm on esophagus and 2 cm onto stomach**.  
- **Partial anterior fundoplication (Dor)** or **posterior (Toupet)** is added to prevent reflux.  
- Provides **>90% long-term symptom relief** and low morbidity.  

### Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy (POEM)
- Developed by **Inoue (2008)** following animal studies by **Pasricha (2007)**.  
- Utilizes **endoscopic submucosal tunneling** to perform a myotomy from inside the esophageal wall.  
- Early outcomes show **high success and low complication rates** in children at specialized centers.  
- No fundoplication is performed, so **GERD surveillance is required** post-procedure.  

### Salvage and Rare Options
- **Temporary stents** have been attempted after failed myotomy but lack supporting evidence.  
- **Partial esophagectomy or replacement** reserved for **end-stage, megaesophagus-type disease** after multiple failed interventions.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication** remains the **gold standard** surgical therapy for achalasia.  
- **POEM** offers a minimally invasive alternative with expanding pediatric data.  
- Stenting and esophagectomy are **last-resort options** for refractory disease.  

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Full (360°) fundoplication increases dysphagia risk and is not standard.  
- **C:** POEM is safe and effective when performed by trained teams.  
- **D:** Stents lack evidence and are not first-line or preferred.  
- **E:** Esophagectomy is reserved for end-stage failure cases only.

Correct answer: B — Laparoscopic Heller myotomy with partial fundoplication is the most common and definitive treatment for achalasia in children.
