A 12-year-old girl presents with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids. She reports regurgitation of undigested food and mild chest discomfort after eating. Barium swallow shows a bird-beak narrowing of the distal esophagus, and esophageal manometry confirms absent peristalsis with failure of lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. Which of the following best describes the underlying pathogenesis of this disorder?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Achalasia** results from **loss of inhibitory ganglion cells** within the **myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus** of the distal esophagus and lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This leads to **failure of LES relaxation** and **absence of peristalsis**, producing progressive dysphagia.

Evidence strongly supports an **autoimmune mechanism** triggered by **viral infection** in genetically predisposed hosts. Histologic studies show **lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration** of the myenteric plexus, and **antimyenteric autoantibodies** have been detected in affected individuals. Associations with autoimmune diseases (e.g., **Sjögren syndrome, lupus, hypothyroidism**) are markedly increased. Certain **HLA haplotypes** (e.g., **HLA-DQ1\*0101**) and polymorphisms in **nitric oxide synthase** and **vasoactive intestinal peptide genes** further support a genetic predisposition.

| Etiologic Factor | Supporting Evidence |
|------------------|----------------------|
| Autoimmunity | High association with autoimmune diseases; presence of antimyenteric antibodies |
| Viral trigger | HSV-1, varicella zoster, measles, and JC virus DNA found in myenteric tissues of affected patients |
| Genetic susceptibility | HLA-DQ1\*0101, NOS and VIP gene variants; familial cases (e.g., Allgrove syndrome) |

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Achalasia is caused by *loss of inhibitory neurons* in the distal esophagus.  
- Most evidence supports an *autoimmune response triggered by viral infection* in genetically predisposed individuals.  
- Loss of nitric oxide–mediated relaxation explains the manometric finding of *high LES pressure and absent peristalsis.*

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Smooth muscle degeneration is secondary, not primary.  
- **C:** Viral infection alone does not cause achalasia without immune involvement.  
- **D:** Reflux-induced fibrosis causes peptic stricture, not achalasia.  
- **E:** Enzyme deficiency is not a known mechanism; nitric oxide loss is secondary to neuronal destruction.

Correct answer: B — Autoimmune destruction of myenteric ganglion cells triggered by viral infection in genetically predisposed individuals.
