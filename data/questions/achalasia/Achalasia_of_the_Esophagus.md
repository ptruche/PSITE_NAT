A 12-year-old boy presents with **progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids** and occasional regurgitation of undigested food. He denies odynophagia or weight loss. Barium swallow reveals a **dilated esophagus with distal tapering** resembling a “bird’s beak.” High-resolution manometry demonstrates **absence of peristalsis**, **elevated resting LES pressure**, and **incomplete LES relaxation**. 

Which of the following best describes the underlying disorder?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Explanation:**  
This presentation is classic for **primary (idiopathic) achalasia**, a rare esophageal motility disorder defined by three hallmark abnormalities: (1) **absence of peristalsis** in the distal esophagus, (2) **high resting LES pressure**, and (3) **failure of LES relaxation** with swallowing. The pathophysiology involves **degeneration of inhibitory neurons** in the **myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus**, leading to unopposed cholinergic tone and impaired bolus transit. 

Patients develop **progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids**, regurgitation of undigested food, and esophageal dilation over time. Primary achalasia is idiopathic, whereas **secondary achalasia** (pseudoachalasia) may occur from **Chagas disease**, **malignancy** at the gastroesophageal junction, or **neurologic injury**. 

**Diagnostic findings:**  
- **Barium swallow:** “Bird’s beak” tapering at LES with proximal dilation  
- **Manometry (gold standard):** Aperistalsis, elevated LES pressure, and incomplete LES relaxation  
- **Endoscopy:** Used to exclude malignancy; mucosa is typically normal  

**Treatment options:**  
- **Heller myotomy** (laparoscopic or robotic) ± **fundoplication** to prevent reflux  
- **POEM (Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy)**—minimally invasive alternative  
- **Pneumatic dilation** or **botulinum toxin injection** for poor surgical candidates  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Achalasia = *failure of LES relaxation + absent peristalsis + high LES tone*  
- Primary form is idiopathic; secondary forms due to Chagas disease or malignancy  
- Diagnosis confirmed by **high-resolution manometry**  
- **Definitive treatment:** mechanical or surgical LES disruption  

**Why the Other Options Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Diffuse esophageal spasm shows preserved LES relaxation and uncoordinated peristalsis.  
- **B:** Scleroderma esophagus has a *hypotensive* LES and absent peristalsis—opposite of achalasia.  
- **D:** GERD leads to a weak LES, not failure to relax.  
- **E:** Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis affects gastric outlet, not esophageal motility.  

**Correct answer: C — Idiopathic achalasia with absent peristalsis, hypertensive LES, and incomplete LES relaxation.**
