A: Upper endoscopy alone is sufficient for both diagnosis and classification of achalasia
B: High-resolution manometry is the gold standard for confirming impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis
C: Esophageal pH monitoring is required to confirm the diagnosis
D: Chest CT is diagnostic when showing a dilated esophagus with air-fluid levels
E: Barium esophagram findings are nonspecific and cannot suggest achalasia
correct: B

A 9-year-old child presents with progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, recurrent regurgitation, and weight loss. Barium esophagram demonstrates a markedly dilated esophagus tapering to a narrow “bird-beak” at the gastroesophageal junction. Upper endoscopy reveals no obstructing lesion or mass. Which of the following studies is considered the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis and characterizing disease subtype?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Diagnosis of achalasia** requires demonstration of **impaired lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation** and **absent normal esophageal peristalsis** in the *absence of mechanical obstruction.*  
The diagnostic evaluation typically proceeds in a structured sequence:

| Diagnostic Test | Role | Findings |
|------------------|------|-----------|
| **Barium esophagram** | Initial, often diagnostic | *Dilated esophagus* with *bird’s-beak tapering* of the distal segment; retained contrast, absence of peristalsis |
| **Upper endoscopy (EGD)** | Exclude secondary causes | Rule out *tumors, peptic stricture, eosinophilic esophagitis, or extrinsic compression* |
| **High-resolution manometry (HRM)** | **Gold standard** | Confirms *elevated integrated relaxation pressure (IRP >15 mmHg)* and *absent peristalsis*; defines **Type I–III achalasia** |
| **Additional studies (CT, EUS)** | As indicated | Evaluate for pseudoachalasia or infiltrative lesions |

**High-resolution manometry (HRM)** has revolutionized achalasia diagnosis. It allows precise quantification of LES relaxation and esophageal pressurization patterns, enabling **classification into Type I–III subtypes**. This information has important prognostic and therapeutic implications.

**Key Points in Workup:**  
1. **Rule out mechanical obstruction** before labeling a patient with achalasia.  
2. **Barium esophagram** is a useful screening tool, especially in children.  
3. **Upper endoscopy** ensures no secondary cause (pseudoachalasia) is missed.  
4. **HRM** provides the definitive physiological diagnosis and guides management.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Endoscopy alone cannot confirm achalasia; it primarily rules out other causes.  
- **C:** pH monitoring evaluates reflux, not motility.  
- **D:** CT can show esophageal dilation but is not diagnostic.  
- **E:** The bird’s-beak pattern is highly characteristic of achalasia, especially in later disease.

Correct answer: B — High-resolution manometry is the gold standard for confirming impaired LES relaxation and absent peristalsis.
