A: Surgery is indicated only for patients with chest pain refractory to nitrates
B: Surgical myotomy is first-line therapy for all patients regardless of diagnostic confirmation

D: Surgery is reserved for patients with recurrent aspiration pneumonia only
E: Surgical myotomy should be avoided in children due to poor long-term outcomes
correct: C

A 13-year-old child has progressive dysphagia and regurgitation despite several sessions of pneumatic dilation and two endoscopic botulinum toxin injections. High-resolution manometry confirms persistent incomplete lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and absent peristalsis. Which of the following best describes the indication for surgical management in this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Surgical myotomy** (most commonly **laparoscopic Heller myotomy** or **peroral endoscopic myotomy [POEM]**) is indicated for **patients with symptomatic, manometrically confirmed achalasia**, particularly when **less invasive modalities fail** or **durable relief is desired.**

### Indications for Surgery
1. **Symptomatic dysphagia** with **confirmed achalasia** (via manometry, barium esophagram, or endoscopy).  
2. **Failure of medical therapy** (calcium channel blockers or nitrates).  
3. **Failure or recurrence** following **pneumatic dilation** or **botulinum toxin injection.**  
4. **Preference for definitive, durable therapy** in appropriate surgical candidates.  

| Therapy | Typical Use | Durability | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| **Calcium channel blockers / nitrates** | Mild symptoms or nonoperative bridge | Poor | Short-acting palliation |
| **Botulinum toxin injection** | Temporary relief or poor surgical candidate | Short | Duration ≈4 months; repeat needed |
| **Pneumatic dilation** | Non-surgical option in older children/adults | Intermediate | May require repeat; risk of perforation |
| **Heller myotomy / POEM** | **Definitive therapy** | **Excellent** | Long-term symptom relief, especially when combined with fundoplication |

**Why Surgery Is Preferred:**  
- Surgical myotomy directly divides the hypertensive LES fibers, restoring normal esophageal emptying.  
- It offers the **highest long-term success rate** (>90%) compared with dilation or botulinum toxin.  
- In children and adolescents, surgery is safe, effective, and associated with sustained symptom relief.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Surgery is indicated for **documented achalasia with dysphagia**, either as **first-line definitive therapy** or after failure of medical/endoscopic treatments.  
- **Laparoscopic Heller myotomy** (± fundoplication) remains the **standard of care** for durable symptom control.  
- **POEM** is emerging as a minimally invasive alternative with comparable efficacy.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Chest pain alone without manometric confirmation is not an indication.  
- **B:** Surgery should follow diagnostic confirmation.  
- **D:** Aspiration can occur, but surgery is indicated primarily for dysphagia.  
- **E:** Surgery provides excellent long-term outcomes in children.

Correct answer: C — Surgery is indicated for symptomatic achalasia confirmed on workup or after failure of less invasive treatments.
