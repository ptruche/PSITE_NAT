A: Patients are typically cured after surgery and do not require long-term follow-up
B: Routine annual follow-up is recommended, focusing on symptoms, weight, and reflux surveillance
C: Postoperative reflux symptoms reliably predict abnormal pH testing and require no further evaluation
D: Mild recurrent dysphagia (Eckardt <3) should prompt immediate repeat myotomy
E: Endoscopic surveillance every 6 months is mandatory to prevent carcinoma
correct: B

A 10-year-old patient underwent a laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia six months ago. The patient reports mild intermittent dysphagia and occasional regurgitation but is gaining weight appropriately. What is the most appropriate long-term follow-up strategy for this patient?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Achalasia** is a **chronic motility disorder** requiring **long-term follow-up** after surgical or endoscopic therapy to monitor for symptom recurrence, reflux, and nutritional status. Even after successful myotomy, **esophageal peristalsis does not recover**, and symptoms can recur with growth or incomplete LES division.

### Key Principles of Follow-Up

| Aspect | Approach | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Early postoperative period** | Monitor **weight gain, dysphagia, and GER symptoms** | Assess early symptom improvement |
| **Reflux surveillance** | Evaluate with **pH or impedance testing** if GER symptoms persist | Only ~50% correlation between symptoms and proven GERD |
| **Long-term schedule** | **At least annual follow-up** once stable | Chronic condition with potential for late recurrence |
| **Functional assessment** | Use **Eckardt scale**, **endoscopy**, **manometry**, or **functional luminal imaging (FLIP)** for symptomatic patients | Identify persistent obstruction or incomplete myotomy |
| **Recurrence management** | - **Eckardt <3:** Observe (“watchful waiting”)  
- **Eckardt ≥3 or weight loss:** Investigate with endoscopy/manometry | Stratified approach based on symptom severity |

### Recurrent or Persistent Symptoms
- **Mild (Eckardt <3):** Observation is reasonable; symptoms often stabilize.  
- **Moderate/severe (Eckardt ≥3):** Perform **endoscopy and manometry** to assess for **incomplete myotomy** or **LES hypertone.**  
- **Management options:** Balloon dilation, repeat myotomy, or rarely esophageal replacement for refractory cases.

### Additional Considerations
- **GER monitoring:** Many patients have reflux-like symptoms post-myotomy; confirm with objective testing before long-term PPI use.  
- **Quality of life:** Chronic motility and dietary modifications may impact wellbeing—address as part of holistic care.  
- **Endoscopic screening:** No standardized interval; individualized to clinician judgment.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
- Follow-up is **lifelong and structured**, emphasizing symptom tracking, nutrition, and reflux assessment.  
- Persistent or recurrent symptoms require physiologic evaluation.  
- Mild recurrence can be safely observed; severe cases need further investigation and possibly repeat intervention.

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Achalasia is chronic; follow-up is essential.  
- **C:** Symptom–reflux correlation is poor; objective testing is required.  
- **D:** Mild recurrence does not warrant immediate reoperation.  
- **E:** Routine semiannual endoscopy is not evidence-based.

Correct answer: B — Routine annual follow-up is recommended, focusing on symptoms, weight, and reflux surveillance.
