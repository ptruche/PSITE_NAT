A: Mucosal perforation during Heller myotomy occurs in over 50% of cases and requires esophagectomy
B: Incomplete myotomy most often occurs due to inadequate division on the gastric side and presents with early recurrent dysphagia
C: Pneumoperitoneum following POEM is rare and indicates an emergent perforation requiring reoperation
D: Pleural effusion and pneumothorax after POEM are uncommon and self-limiting in most cases
E: Submucosal hemorrhage after POEM requires immediate thoracotomy in all patients
correct: B

A 10-year-old patient develops recurrent dysphagia several weeks after laparoscopic Heller myotomy for achalasia. Endoscopy reveals an intact mucosa and widely patent esophageal lumen, but contrast study suggests narrowing at the gastroesophageal junction. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this complication?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Complications** after **Heller myotomy** and **peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM)** can involve **mucosal injury**, **incomplete myotomy**, or **gas-related events** due to insufflation during endoscopic tunneling. Understanding these helps anticipate, prevent, and manage postoperative issues.

### Complications After Heller Myotomy

| Complication | Approximate Incidence | Mechanism / Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Mucosal perforation** | ~6% (range 0–19%) | Occurs during circular muscle division; prevent by lifting fibers and using precise cautery (L hook preferred to Harmonic®) |
| **Incomplete myotomy** | Up to 15% | Most commonly due to **inadequate extension onto gastric side**; presents as **early recurrent dysphagia** |
| **Reflux symptoms** | Variable | Especially if fundoplication omitted |
| **Bleeding** | Rare | Controlled with tamponade rather than cautery near submucosa |

### Complications After POEM

| Complication | Incidence | Management |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **Pneumoperitoneum** | >80% | Usually benign; may require trocar decompression if symptomatic |
| **Pneumothorax** | ~7% | Observe or insert pigtail catheter if symptomatic |
| **Pneumomediastinum** | ~5% | Conservative management with observation and oxygen |
| **Pleural effusion** | ~15% | Typically resolves spontaneously |
| **Submucosal tunnel hemorrhage** | ~1.5% | Manage endoscopically (clip, coagulation) |
| **Mucosal leak / tunnel leak** | Rare | Clip closure, OverStitch™, or temporary stent |

### Key Prevention Strategies
- **Use L hook cautery** for controlled dissection to minimize thermal injury.  
- **Elevate circular fibers** before division to avoid mucosal perforation.  
- **Ensure gastric extension (2–4 cm)** of myotomy to prevent incomplete release.  
- **Monitor for insufflation-related complications** post-POEM; treat symptomatically.

**Key Takeaways:**  
- **Mucosal perforation** occurs in ~6% of Heller myotomies—usually repairable intraoperatively.  
- **Incomplete myotomy** (often on gastric side) causes early recurrent dysphagia.  
- **Pneumoperitoneum and related events** are common after POEM but rarely dangerous.  
- Most complications are **manageable without reoperation.**

**Why Other Answers Are Wrong:**  
- **A:** Perforation rate is ~6%, not 50%; most are repaired easily.  
- **C:** Pneumoperitoneum is expected, not an emergency.  
- **D:** While partially true, B is the more specific and directly relevant answer.  
- **E:** Submucosal hemorrhage rarely requires thoracotomy.

Correct answer: B — Incomplete myotomy most often occurs due to inadequate division on the gastric side and presents with early recurrent dysphagia.
