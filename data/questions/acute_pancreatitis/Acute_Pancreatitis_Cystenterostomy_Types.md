A: Cystduodenostomy or cystjejunostomy is chosen based on cyst location relative to the stomach and duodenum, creating a direct internal drainage anastomosis
B: All pseudocysts should undergo cystgastrostomy regardless of anatomic relationship to surrounding structures
C: External drainage is preferred for all pseudocysts not adjacent to the stomach to prevent intra-abdominal contamination
D: Laparoscopic cystjejunostomy is contraindicated in pediatric patients due to high recurrence
E: Cystduodenostomy requires a Roux-en-Y reconstruction to divert pancreatic secretions
correct: A

A 12-year-old boy with a symptomatic pancreatic pseudocyst has imaging showing the cyst compressing the second portion of the duodenum. The pseudocyst is not adherent to the posterior wall of the stomach. The surgical team decides to perform an internal drainage procedure.  

Which of the following best describes the appropriate operative approach and rationale?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Internal drainage procedures** for pancreatic pseudocysts are selected based on **cyst location** relative to adjacent organs (stomach, duodenum, jejunum) to provide the **most direct, safe, and durable route for drainage** while minimizing pancreatic dissection and bleeding.

**1. Cystduodenostomy:**  
- Chosen when the **pseudocyst indents into or lies adjacent to the duodenum** (commonly the pancreatic head).  
- The **duodenum is opened anteriorly** directly over the area of indentation.  
- The cyst is **palpated and confirmed**, then **opened and anastomosed** to the duodenal wall.  
- Benefits: **shorter drainage route** and **reduced bleeding** risk since less pancreatic tissue is traversed.  
- Closure of duodenum parallels **cystgastrostomy technique**.  

**2. Cystjejunostomy:**  
- Used when the pseudocyst is **not contiguous with the stomach or duodenum**, e.g., located **through the transverse mesocolon**.  
- The cyst is opened and **anastomosed to a Roux-en-Y or loop of jejunum**, which can be created using a **stapler or hand-sewn technique**.  
- Provides reliable drainage when other sites are inaccessible.  

**3. Laparoscopic or combined approaches:**  
- Increasingly feasible even in **pediatric patients**.  
- **Laparoscopic cystjejunostomy** or **transgastric drainage** can be done using staplers or energy devices.  
- Outcomes are favorable in limited case series, demonstrating **safety and effectiveness** comparable to open surgery.

| Procedure | Ideal Location | Technique Highlights |
|------------|----------------|----------------------|
| **Cystgastrostomy** | Lesser sac, behind stomach | Posterior gastric wall incision |
| **Cystduodenostomy** | Cyst indenting into duodenum | Anterior duodenotomy + cyst incision |
| **Cystjejunostomy** | Cyst not adherent to stomach/duodenum | Roux-en-Y or loop jejunal anastomosis |
| **Laparoscopic drainage** | Variable | Combined stapled or sutured technique |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** A cystgastrostomy is only appropriate if the cyst abuts the stomach.  
- **C:** External drainage increases fistula and recurrence risk.  
- **D:** Laparoscopic drainage is feasible in children.  
- **E:** Cystduodenostomy does not require a Roux-en-Y reconstruction.  

**Key takeaway:** The choice of **cystenterostomy** technique depends on **cyst location**. **Cystduodenostomy** drains cysts indenting the duodenum, while **cystjejunostomy** is used when the cyst lies remote from the stomach or duodenum.

Correct answer: A — Cystduodenostomy or cystjejunostomy is chosen based on cyst location relative to the stomach and duodenum, creating a direct internal drainage anastomosis.
