E: Local complications without systemic manifestations or organ failure
correct: B

A 13-year-old boy presents with severe epigastric pain, nausea, and vomiting. He is febrile to 38.5°C, tachycardic, and mildly hypotensive. Labs show elevated amylase and lipase. Over the next 72 hours, he develops hypoxemia requiring supplemental oxygen and rising serum creatinine levels. CT scan reveals peripancreatic fluid collections and areas of necrosis. 

According to the revised 2012 Atlanta classification, how should this case be classified?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **revised 2012 Atlanta classification** defines the *severity* of acute pancreatitis based on **organ failure** and **local/systemic complications**:

| Classification | Organ Failure | Local/Systemic Complications | Clinical Course |
|----------------|----------------|------------------------------|-----------------|
| **Mild** | None | None | Resolves within 1 week; no mortality |
| **Moderate** | *Transient* organ failure (<48h) and/or local complications | Possible | Usually resolves with supportive care |
| **Severe** | *Persistent* organ failure (>48h), often involving multiple systems | Frequent | High morbidity and mortality; ICU-level care required |

This patient demonstrates **persistent organ failure (>48 hours)** involving both **renal** and **respiratory** systems, consistent with **severe acute pancreatitis**.

**Supporting definitions:**  
- *Transient organ failure* → <48 hours (moderate).  
- *Persistent organ failure* → >48 hours (severe).  
- *Local complications* include necrosis, pseudocyst, abscess, or peripancreatic fluid collections.  
- *Systemic complications* include respiratory failure, renal insufficiency, shock, or sepsis.

**Pediatric considerations:**  
Severity scoring in children can use the **Debanto criteria**, where ≥3 of the following predict severe disease:  
1. Age <7 years or weight <23 kg  
2. WBC >18.5K/μL or LDH >2000 at admission  
3. At 48h: calcium <8.3 mg/dL, albumin <2.6 g/dL, fluid sequestration >75 mL/kg/48h, or BUN rise >5 mg/dL  

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **A:** Describes moderate pancreatitis.  
- **C:** Describes mild pancreatitis.  
- **D:** Etiology (gallstones) affects recurrence, not classification.  
- **E:** Local complications alone indicate moderate, not severe, pancreatitis.

**Key takeaway:** In the **Atlanta 2012 classification**, **persistent organ failure (>48 hours)** defines **severe acute pancreatitis**, regardless of imaging findings or etiology.

Correct answer: B — Persistent organ failure lasting >48 hours with systemic complications defines severe acute pancreatitis.
