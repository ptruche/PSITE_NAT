id: PANCREATITIS-022
A: ERCP with stone or plug removal and sphincterotomy if ampullary obstruction is present
B: Empiric sphincterotomy for all cases of recurrent pancreatitis regardless of imaging findings
C: Delayed cholecystectomy several months after discharge for gallstone-related pancreatitis
D: Routine open exploration of the common bile duct for all pediatric cases
E: Observation only, as most ductal obstructions resolve spontaneously
correct: A

A 10-year-old girl presents with recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis. Imaging reveals dilation of the pancreatic duct and a suspected stone at the ampulla. She continues to have pain and poor drainage despite conservative management. The pediatric surgery team is consulted for definitive management.  

Which of the following represents the most appropriate next step in management?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Pancreatic ductal obstruction** can occur due to **stones, protein plugs, or structural anomalies** (e.g., ampullary stricture, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, pancreaticobiliary malunion). The goal of therapy is to **restore ductal drainage** and relieve obstruction.

**1. Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):**  
- **First-line therapeutic intervention** for ductal obstruction.  
- Allows:  
  - **Stone or protein plug clearance** from the pancreatic duct.  
  - **Stenting** for ductal disruption or stricture.  
  - **Sphincterotomy** for **ampullary stricture** to improve drainage.  
- Requires **careful patient selection**, as benefit is limited to patients with **mechanical or ampullary obstruction**.

**2. Surgical intervention:**  
- **Open sphincterotomy** may be required if ERCP is unsuccessful or not feasible.  
- **Structural anomalies** (e.g., pancreaticobiliary malunion) may require tailored surgical correction to reduce recurrence.

**3. Gallstone pancreatitis:**  
- Once the acute episode resolves, **cholecystectomy should be performed prior to discharge** to prevent recurrence.  
- Delay increases the risk of early recurrent pancreatitis.

| Etiology | Recommended Intervention | Timing |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Ampullary stricture / obstruction** | ERCP with sphincterotomy | Early, once stable |
| **Pancreatic ductal stone or plug** | ERCP with clearance ± stent | Early |
| **Gallstones** | Laparoscopic cholecystectomy | Before discharge |
| **Structural anomaly (e.g. PBM)** | Corrective surgery | Elective after stabilization |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Sphincterotomy without clear obstruction risks complications.  
- **C:** Cholecystectomy should be performed **before discharge**, not delayed.  
- **D:** Routine open exploration is unnecessary in most pediatric cases.  
- **E:** True ductal obstructions do not resolve spontaneously.  

**Key takeaway:** For **pancreatic ductal obstruction**, **ERCP with clearance or stenting** is the preferred therapy, and **sphincterotomy** is indicated when an **ampullary stricture** is present. **Cholecystectomy** should be done before discharge for gallstone pancreatitis.

Correct answer: A — ERCP with stone or plug removal and sphincterotomy if ampullary obstruction is present.
