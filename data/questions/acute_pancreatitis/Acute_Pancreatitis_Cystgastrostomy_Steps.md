A: Create a communication between the posterior gastric wall and the pseudocyst wall with electrocautery after confirming cyst location and then secure the edges with absorbable sutures
B: Insert a large-bore drain into the pseudocyst percutaneously under ultrasound guidance for continuous drainage
C: Excise the pseudocyst entirely with a rim of surrounding pancreatic tissue to prevent recurrence
D: Create a communication between the anterior gastric wall and peritoneal cavity for external cyst drainage
E: Perform laparoscopic fenestration of the cyst into the peritoneum to allow spontaneous resorption
correct: A

A 13-year-old boy presents with a symptomatic, mature pancreatic pseudocyst compressing the posterior wall of the stomach. The surgical team decides to perform an open cystgastrostomy.  

Which of the following best describes the key steps of this operation?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

A **cystgastrostomy** is a **surgical drainage procedure** in which a **communication is created between the posterior wall of the stomach and the anterior wall of an adherent pancreatic pseudocyst**, allowing internal drainage of cyst contents into the stomach.

**1. Operative steps:**  
1. Open the **anterior stomach wall** (anterior gastrostomy) to access the posterior gastric wall.  
2. **Palpate the pseudocyst** through the posterior wall in the lesser sac to confirm its location.  
3. Confirm the cyst by **aspirating fluid** using a needle and syringe (high-amylase contents).  
4. Incise both the **posterior gastric wall** and **pseudocyst wall** using **electrocautery**, creating a sufficient opening for drainage.  
5. **Biopsy** the cyst wall to rule out **cystic neoplasm**, which is rare in children but should always be excluded.  
6. Secure the communication with **absorbable sutures** (interrupted or running) to ensure hemostasis and maintain the anastomosis.  
7. **Close the anterior gastrostomy** and then the **abdominal wall**. No drains are needed.

**2. Principles of cystenterostomy:**  
- If the pseudocyst is not adherent to the stomach, a **cystduodenostomy** or **cystjejunostomy** can be performed, depending on cyst location.  
- The goal is to create **internal drainage** into the GI tract, avoiding external drainage and risk of **pancreatic fistula**.

| Approach | Connection Site | Indication |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Cystgastrostomy** | Posterior stomach wall → cyst | Lesser sac pseudocyst adherent to stomach |
| **Cystduodenostomy** | Duodenum → head pseudocyst | Head of pancreas cyst |
| **Cystjejunostomy** | Jejunum → tail pseudocyst | Distal or multiple cysts |

**3. Key technical points:**  
- Ensure **firm adherence** between cyst and stomach to prevent leakage.  
- Adequate opening prevents premature closure and recurrence.  
- Avoid drains unless contamination or bleeding occurs.  

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Percutaneous drainage is for immature or infected cysts, not mature symptomatic pseudocysts.  
- **C:** Excision of pseudocyst is not necessary and risks pancreatic injury.  
- **D:** External drainage risks fistula and infection.  
- **E:** Fenestration into peritoneum is unsafe and ineffective.  

**Key takeaway:** **Cystgastrostomy** involves **creating and securing a communication** between the **posterior gastric wall and pseudocyst**, confirmed by aspiration, with **biopsy to exclude neoplasm** and **no need for drains**.

Correct answer: A — Create a communication between the posterior gastric wall and the pseudocyst wall with electrocautery after confirming cyst location and then secure the edges with absorbable sutures.
