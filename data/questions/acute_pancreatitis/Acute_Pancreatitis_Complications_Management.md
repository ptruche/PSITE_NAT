id: PANCREATITIS-016
A: Observation for spontaneous resolution unless the pseudocyst becomes symptomatic or complicated
B: Immediate percutaneous drainage of all pseudocysts to prevent rupture
C: Routine fine-needle aspiration of necrotic collections to rule out infection
D: Empiric antibiotics for all patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, regardless of culture status
E: Immediate surgical necrosectomy in the first week to prevent infection
correct: A

A 13-year-old boy is recovering from severe acute pancreatitis. Three weeks later, he develops early satiety and mild epigastric discomfort. CT scan shows a 5 cm well-circumscribed peripancreatic fluid collection without gas or solid debris. He is afebrile and his leukocyte count is normal.  

What is the most appropriate management at this time?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Pancreatic pseudocysts** and **necrotic collections** are potential complications of acute pancreatitis. Management depends on symptoms, maturity, and evidence of infection.

**1. Pancreatic pseudocyst:**  
- Represents a **mature, encapsulated fluid collection** that develops **≥4 weeks** after pancreatitis.  
- **Initial management:** Observation, as most resolve spontaneously within weeks to months.  
- **Intervention:** Only for **symptomatic**, **infected**, or **complicated** pseudocysts (e.g., pain, obstruction, bleeding, rupture).  
- Drainage options include **endoscopic, percutaneous, or surgical** once the wall has matured.  

**2. Necrotizing pancreatitis:**  
- Managed **supportively** unless infection or obstruction occurs.  
- **Avoid routine aspiration** of necrosis for culture—reserved for clinical deterioration or CT evidence of gas in the necrotic area.  
- Infection typically develops **after 2 or more weeks**, presenting with fever, leukocytosis, or sepsis.  
- Common pathogens: **Gram-negative rods (Enterobacter, E. coli)**, occasionally **MRSA** or **Enterococcus**.  
- **CT findings of air** in necrotic tissue are highly suggestive of infection.  

**3. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis:**  
- Requires **resuscitation**, correction of coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia, and **embolization or surgery** for ongoing bleeding.  

| Complication | Timing | Initial Management | When to Intervene |
|---------------|---------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Pseudocyst** | ≥4 weeks | Observation | Symptomatic, infected, or enlarging |
| **Necrosis (sterile)** | Early | Supportive only | None unless infected |
| **Infected necrosis** | ≥2 weeks | Antibiotics ± drainage/debridement | Fever, gas on CT |
| **Hemorrhage** | Variable | Resuscitation | Embolization/surgery if unstable |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Routine drainage is not indicated; most pseudocysts resolve spontaneously.  
- **C:** Aspiration of necrosis increases infection risk; not routine.  
- **D:** Empiric antibiotics for all necrosis cases are not recommended.  
- **E:** Early necrosectomy worsens outcomes; delayed intervention (≥4 weeks) is preferred if needed.  

**Key takeaway:** Most **pancreatic pseudocysts resolve spontaneously**. Drainage or intervention is indicated only when **symptomatic, infected, or complicated**. **Necrosis** is managed supportively unless **infection** develops.

Correct answer: A — Observation for spontaneous resolution unless the pseudocyst becomes symptomatic or complicated.
