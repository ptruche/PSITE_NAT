id: PANCREATITIS-018
A: Reserved for cases of suspected or confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis
B: Routinely administered to all patients with acute pancreatitis to prevent infection
C: Indicated for all patients with necrosis regardless of culture or imaging findings
D: Given prophylactically in severe pancreatitis to reduce mortality
E: Indicated whenever patients with pancreatitis develop fever or leukocytosis
correct: A

A 14-year-old boy presents with severe acute pancreatitis and persistent fever. CT imaging reveals areas of pancreatic necrosis without gas formation. He is hemodynamically stable and receiving supportive care. The ICU team asks whether antibiotics should be initiated to prevent infection of the necrotic tissue.  

Which of the following best describes the role of antibiotics in this setting?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Antibiotics are not routinely indicated** in **acute pancreatitis**, even in the presence of sterile necrosis. Prophylactic antibiotics have **not demonstrated a mortality benefit** or clear reduction in infectious complications in randomized trials.

**1. Prophylactic antibiotics:**  
- Evidence does **not support their use** for preventing infection in necrotizing pancreatitis.  
- A Cochrane review suggested a possible trend toward benefit but results were **not statistically significant**, and study quality was poor.  
- The carbapenem **imipenem** showed reduced pancreatic infection rates but **did not decrease mortality**.  

**2. Indications for antibiotics:**  
- Reserved for **suspected or confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis**.  
- **CT evidence of gas** within necrotic tissue is strongly suggestive of infection.  
- Empiric antibiotics should be initiated when infection is suspected, targeting **Gram-negative rods** (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae) and **Gram-positive organisms** (e.g., Enterococcus, MRSA).  
- **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA)** for culture is rarely performed due to risk of **introducing infection** and **false negatives**.

**3. Clinical differentiation:**  
- **Fever, leukocytosis, and pain** can occur from sterile inflammation alone, complicating diagnosis.  
- Thus, clinical suspicion plus imaging findings guide therapy.

| Scenario | Recommendation | Rationale |
|-----------|----------------|------------|
| **Mild pancreatitis** | No antibiotics | Inflammation, not infection |
| **Sterile necrosis** | No antibiotics | No proven benefit |
| **Infected necrosis (gas on CT)** | Start broad-spectrum antibiotics | Source control essential |
| **Cholangitis/obstruction** | Antibiotics + ERCP | Separate infection source |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B/D:** Routine prophylaxis offers no benefit and increases resistance risk.  
- **C:** Necrosis alone is not infection.  
- **E:** Fever and leukocytosis are nonspecific and do not mandate antibiotics.  

**Key takeaway:** **Antibiotics are indicated only for suspected or confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis**, not as prophylaxis or for sterile inflammation.

Correct answer: A — Reserved for cases of suspected or confirmed infected pancreatic necrosis.
