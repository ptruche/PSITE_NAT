A 13-year-old boy is admitted to the PICU with severe necrotizing pancreatitis. Despite aggressive IV fluids and antibiotics, he develops fevers and rising leukocytosis two weeks into his course. CT scan demonstrates air within areas of pancreatic necrosis. Percutaneous drains are placed but output remains high, and his condition fails to improve over the following week.  

Which of the following represents the most appropriate next step in management?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Surgical intervention** in **acute pancreatitis**—particularly in children—is **rare** and reserved for **infected pancreatic necrosis** or **uncontrolled sepsis** despite maximal medical and percutaneous therapy.

**1. Step-up approach to infected necrosis:**  
Management should progress gradually from **least invasive to most invasive**, emphasizing delayed intervention to allow liquefaction and demarcation of necrotic tissue.

| Stage | Intervention | Rationale |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| **1. Medical therapy** | Antibiotics and supportive care | First-line; many resolve without intervention |
| **2. Drainage** | Percutaneous or endoscopic | Source control for infected collections |
| **3. Debridement** | Minimally invasive (endoscopic, laparoscopic, retroperitoneal) | Performed **≥4 weeks** after onset to reduce mortality |
| **4. Open necrosectomy** | Last resort for uncontrolled sepsis or failure of other methods | Associated with **10–20% mortality** in adults |

**2. Timing of surgery:**  
- **Early debridement (<4 weeks)** is associated with increased mortality due to poor tissue demarcation and bleeding risk.  
- **Delayed or minimally invasive approaches** reduce morbidity and allow necrosis to liquefy for safer removal.  

**3. Pediatric considerations:**  
- True mortality and ideal timing in children are extrapolated from adult data, as severe necrotizing disease is **uncommon** in pediatric patients.  
- **Case reports** support similar stepwise strategies.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Early open necrosectomy carries high mortality and should be avoided.  
- **C:** Surgery is indicated only for infected necrosis unresponsive to drainage—not all necrosis.  
- **D:** Prophylactic drain placement is not beneficial and may increase infection risk.  
- **E:** Sterile necrosis is managed supportively; surgery is reserved for infection or deterioration.  

**Key takeaway:**  
Surgery in pediatric pancreatitis is rarely needed. When indicated for **infected necrosis**, a **step-up, delayed, minimally invasive approach** is preferred; early open debridement increases mortality.

Correct answer: A — Delayed minimally invasive debridement after failure of drainage and antibiotic therapy for infected necrosis.
