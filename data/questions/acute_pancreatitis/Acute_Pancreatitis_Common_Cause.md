A 9-year-old boy presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back after being struck in the abdomen by bicycle handlebars. His serum lipase is elevated to 12 times the upper limit of normal. Ultrasound shows no gallstones or biliary dilation.  

Which of the following represents the most common cause of **acute pancreatitis in children**?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **most common cause of acute pancreatitis in children** is **trauma**, particularly **blunt abdominal trauma**. The **mechanism** is typically **compression of the pancreas** against the **vertebral column**, resulting in **ductal disruption** or **parenchymal contusion**.

**1. Traumatic pancreatitis:**  
- Accounts for **up to 30–40%** of pediatric cases.  
- Mechanisms:  
  - **Bicycle handlebar injuries** (classic mechanism).  
  - **Motor vehicle collisions** (seatbelt compression).  
  - **Child abuse** (nonaccidental trauma).  
  - **Postoperative or iatrogenic trauma** (e.g., ERCP, surgery).  
- Typically presents with **epigastric pain** and **elevated amylase/lipase** within hours to days of injury.  
- **CT or MRCP** may reveal contusion, transection, or ductal disruption.

**2. Other common causes (less frequent):**  
- **Choledocholithiasis / gallstones:** 10–20% of pediatric cases; more common in adolescents and obese children.  
- **Medications:** Valproic acid, L-asparaginase, corticosteroids, azathioprine.  
- **Infections:** Mumps, Coxsackie B, HIV.  
- **Congenital anomalies:** Annular pancreas, pancreatic divisum, pancreaticobiliary malunion.  
- **Genetic/metabolic:** PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1 mutations; hypertriglyceridemia, hypercalcemia.  

| Etiology | Typical Age Group | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| **Trauma** | School-age | Most common cause overall |
| **Gallstones** | Adolescents | Related to obesity or hemolysis |
| **Drugs** | Any | Valproic acid, L-asparaginase common |
| **Anatomic** | Any | Pancreatic divisum, annular pancreas |
| **Genetic/metabolic** | Recurrent disease | PRSS1, CFTR, hypertriglyceridemia |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Gallstones are a common cause in adults but not the leading cause in children.  
- **C:** Viral causes are uncommon and usually mild.  
- **D:** CF may cause chronic rather than acute pancreatitis.  
- **E:** Drug-induced cases are less frequent than trauma.  

**Key takeaway:**  
In **pediatric acute pancreatitis**, **trauma**—especially from **blunt abdominal impact** such as **bicycle handlebar injuries**—is the **most common cause**, distinguishing it from adults, where **gallstones and alcohol** predominate.

Correct answer: A — Blunt abdominal trauma.
