A: Distal pancreatectomy for pseudocysts confined to the pancreatic tail, with possible spleen preservation if inflammation permits
B: Total pancreatectomy for all pseudocysts involving the distal pancreas to prevent recurrence
C: Percutaneous drainage as definitive management for tail pseudocysts to avoid splenic injury
D: Routine splenectomy with all distal pancreatectomies due to risk of vascular compromise
E: Drain placement alone, as pseudocysts of the tail do not recur after aspiration
correct: A

A 13-year-old boy presents with a symptomatic pancreatic pseudocyst located within the tail of the pancreas, confirmed by MRI. He has failed percutaneous drainage and continues to have pain and poor oral tolerance. The surgical team plans a definitive procedure.  

Which of the following best describes the appropriate operative approach and principles of management?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

When a **pancreatic pseudocyst** or **ductal disruption** is **confined to the pancreatic tail**, a **distal pancreatectomy** provides definitive treatment. The goal is to remove the **diseased or injured pancreatic segment** while minimizing recurrence and preserving splenic function when possible.

**1. Indications:**  
- Disease localized to the **pancreatic tail** (confirmed preoperatively).  
- Persistent or recurrent pseudocyst despite prior drainage attempts.  
- Associated ductal injury or chronic inflammation isolated to distal pancreas.  

**2. Surgical approach:**  
- Can be performed **laparoscopically** or via a **left subcostal incision**.  
- **Mobilize the splenic flexure** and divide the **gastrocolic ligament** to enter the **lesser sac**.  
- Identify the **pancreatic tail** and **splenic vessels** along its superior border.  
- If feasible, **preserve the spleen** by dissecting the **splenic artery and vein** away from the pancreas (Warshaw technique if necessary).  
- **Transect the pancreas** at the healthy margin using a **stapler** (reinforcement optional).  
- If the **diseased segment with ductal injury** is not removed, **recurrence of pseudocyst** is likely.

**3. Splenic preservation considerations:**  
- Preservation is ideal but may not be possible due to **inflammation, fibrosis, or vascular involvement**.  
- **Splenectomy** may be required if vessels cannot be safely separated.  

| Technique | Approach | Key Points |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| **Distal pancreatectomy** | Laparoscopic or open | Resection of tail; definitive treatment |
| **Spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy** | Preferred | Requires safe isolation of splenic vessels |
| **With splenectomy** | When dissection unsafe | Prevents bleeding, but increases infection risk |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Total pancreatectomy is excessive; only diseased segment resected.  
- **C:** Percutaneous drainage often fails in tail pseudocysts with ductal disruption.  
- **D:** Routine splenectomy is not required; spleen preservation is preferred.  
- **E:** Simple drainage or aspiration leads to recurrence if the diseased segment is not resected.  

**Key takeaway:** **Distal pancreatectomy** is indicated for **pseudocysts or ductal injury confined to the pancreatic tail**, performed **laparoscopically or via open approach**, with **spleen preservation whenever feasible** to prevent recurrence and reduce morbidity.

Correct answer: A — Distal pancreatectomy for pseudocysts confined to the pancreatic tail, with possible spleen preservation if inflammation permits.
