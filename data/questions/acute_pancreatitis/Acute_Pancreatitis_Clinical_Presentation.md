A 12-year-old boy presents with severe abdominal pain and vomiting for one day. The pain began as diffuse discomfort but is now constant, severe, and radiating to his back. He denies trauma, but his mother notes that he had a recent viral illness. On examination, his abdomen is moderately distended with epigastric tenderness, but there is no rebound. He is tachycardic and mildly tachypneic. Labs reveal elevated amylase and lipase. Chest radiograph demonstrates a small left pleural effusion.

Which of the following best characterizes the typical presentation of this condition?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Acute pancreatitis** in children presents with *variable but characteristic patterns* of abdominal and systemic symptoms. The **hallmark feature** is **epigastric or upper abdominal pain**—often radiating to the **back or flanks**—and associated with **nausea and vomiting**. The pain is typically **constant and severe**, unlike colicky pain of biliary or intestinal origin.  

**Associated features:**  
- **Gastrointestinal:** anorexia, diarrhea, weight loss.  
- **Systemic:** fever, tachycardia, hypotension from inflammatory cytokine release.  
- **Respiratory:** pleural effusions or pulmonary edema due to inflammation and third spacing.  
- **Cutaneous:** periumbilical (Cullen sign) or flank (Grey Turner sign) ecchymosis in hemorrhagic pancreatitis.  

**Physical exam spectrum:**  
| Severity | Findings |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Mild** | Soft abdomen, mild tenderness, minimal distention |
| **Moderate** | Distended, tender abdomen with dehydration signs |
| **Severe** | Firm, discolored, distended abdomen, peritonitis, possible shock |

**Key diagnostic history elements:** trauma, recent infection, medications (e.g., valproate, steroids, L-asparaginase), family history (CF, hypertriglyceridemia, calcium disorders).

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Describes biliary colic.  
- **C:** Classic for appendicitis.  
- **D:** Suggests inflammatory bowel disease.  
- **E:** Consistent with diverticulitis, not pancreatitis.  

**Key takeaway:** Pediatric **acute pancreatitis** typically presents with **constant midepigastric or upper abdominal pain radiating to the back**, often accompanied by **nausea, vomiting, and systemic inflammatory findings** such as tachycardia or pleural effusion.

Correct answer: A — Constant epigastric pain radiating to the back with nausea and vomiting, sometimes associated with pleural effusions.
