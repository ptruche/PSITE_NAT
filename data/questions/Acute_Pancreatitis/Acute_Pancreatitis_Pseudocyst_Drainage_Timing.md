id: PANCREATITIS-021
A: Delay internal drainage until the cyst wall matures (typically ≥4–6 weeks) to prevent leakage and complications
B: Perform immediate internal drainage for any symptomatic pseudocyst regardless of wall maturity
C: Use prophylactic percutaneous drainage at diagnosis to prevent infection and rupture
D: Perform surgical cystgastrostomy within one week to prevent cyst enlargement
E: Avoid drainage altogether and treat all pseudocysts conservatively, regardless of symptoms
correct: A

A 12-year-old boy presents six weeks after an episode of necrotizing pancreatitis with persistent abdominal pain, early satiety, and vomiting. CT scan shows a 7 cm pancreatic pseudocyst compressing the stomach. The cyst has a well-defined, mature wall. The surgical team plans an internal drainage procedure.  

Which of the following best describes the rationale for the timing and choice of intervention in this patient?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts** may require drainage, but **timing is critical** to minimize the risk of leakage and recurrence. Intervention should be delayed until the cyst wall has matured sufficiently to allow safe internal drainage.

**1. Timing of drainage:**  
- **Wall maturation** typically occurs after **4–6 weeks**, as the inflammatory process organizes and granulation tissue develops.  
- **Draining too early**—before maturation—risks **spillage of cyst contents into the peritoneum**, causing **peritonitis** or **persistent fistula** formation.  
- Imaging (CT or ultrasound) can confirm **wall maturity** before intervention.

**2. Drainage options:**  
- **Endoscopic drainage:** Transgastric or transduodenal, preferred for accessible cysts adjacent to the GI lumen.  
- **Surgical drainage:** Cystgastrostomy, cystduodenostomy, or cystjejunostomy (open or laparoscopic), depending on **location and patient size**.  
- **External drainage:** Used only when urgent decompression is needed **before wall maturation**; carries higher risk of **pancreatic fistula** and **recurrence**.

| Type of Drainage | Timing | Indication | Risks |
|------------------|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Internal (endo/surgical)** | After 4–6 weeks | Mature wall, persistent symptoms | Low recurrence |
| **External** | Before wall maturity | Urgent decompression | ↑ Fistula, ↑ recurrence |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Early drainage before wall formation leads to peritoneal leakage.  
- **C:** Prophylactic drainage increases infection risk without benefit.  
- **D:** Early cystgastrostomy is dangerous and unnecessary.  
- **E:** Symptomatic pseudocysts require intervention once mature.  

**Key takeaway:** For **symptomatic pseudocysts**, **delay drainage until the cyst wall matures (4–6 weeks)** to minimize leakage and recurrence. **Early external drainage** is reserved for unstable patients who cannot wait for wall formation.

Correct answer: A — Delay internal drainage until the cyst wall matures (≥4–6 weeks) to prevent leakage and complications.
