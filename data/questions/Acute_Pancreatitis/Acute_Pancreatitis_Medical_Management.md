A 9-year-old boy presents with acute pancreatitis confirmed by elevated serum lipase and imaging. He is hemodynamically stable but has persistent vomiting and mild dehydration. His pain is moderate and controlled with IV acetaminophen. The team is planning initial management. 

Which of the following represents the most appropriate next step in management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **cornerstone of medical management** for pediatric acute pancreatitis is **supportive care**, including **fluid resuscitation**, **enteral nutrition**, and **symptom control**. The goal is to prevent hypovolemia, preserve gut integrity, and support recovery while minimizing complications.

**1. Fluid resuscitation**  
- Critically important due to **third spacing and capillary leak**.  
- Use **isotonic crystalloids (e.g., lactated Ringer’s)** with **10–20 mL/kg boluses** as needed, followed by maintenance fluids.  
- Close monitoring of **urine output and hemodynamics** is essential, particularly in moderate or severe cases.

**2. Enteral nutrition**  
- Should be initiated **as early as tolerated** (within 24–48 hours).  
- Maintains intestinal mucosal integrity, reduces bacterial translocation, and lowers risk of infection.  
- **Parenteral nutrition** is reserved for patients who **cannot tolerate enteral feeds**.

**3. Pain management**  
- Though often less severe than in adults, adequate pain control improves comfort and compliance.  
- **NSAIDs** and **narcotics** may be used safely as needed.  

**4. Nasogastric decompression**  
- Indicated only for **persistent vomiting or ileus**, not routinely required.

**5. Therapies with no proven benefit**  
- **Histamine blockers**, **somatostatin**, **glucagon**, **anticholinergics**, and **protease inhibitors** have *no established efficacy* in pediatric pancreatitis.

| Treatment | Role | Evidence |
|------------|------|-----------|
| **IV fluids** | Prevent hypovolemia | Strong evidence |
| **Enteral nutrition** | Maintains gut integrity | Strong evidence |
| **Pain control** | Improves comfort | Supportive evidence |
| **Nasogastric tube** | For persistent emesis only | Conditional |
| **Somatostatin, glucagon, etc.** | No proven benefit | Not recommended |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** NG decompression and parenteral nutrition are not routine.  
- **C:** Antibiotics and somatostatin are not indicated without infection.  
- **D:** Early enteral, not parenteral, nutrition is preferred.  
- **E:** No benefit to histamine blockers or glucagon in acute management.  

**Key takeaway:** Management of pediatric pancreatitis is **supportive**, focusing on **early, aggressive fluid resuscitation and enteral feeding**; other pharmacologic interventions lack proven benefit.

Correct answer: A — Aggressive IV fluid resuscitation and early enteral nutrition are the cornerstones of medical management.
