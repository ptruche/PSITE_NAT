A: Longitudinal opening of the main pancreatic duct from tail to head with Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy to ensure full drainage
B: Excision of the pancreatic head and tail with closure of the main duct to prevent further secretion
C: Limited distal ductotomy and oversewing of the proximal duct to reduce leakage risk
D: Simple drainage of the tail portion of the duct with percutaneous catheter placement
E: Pancreaticojejunostomy using a short limb anastomosed only to the tail of the pancreas
correct: A

A 14-year-old boy with chronic pancreatitis and multiple intraductal stones presents with persistent pain despite maximal medical therapy. Imaging shows a markedly dilated pancreatic duct extending from the tail to the head. The surgical team plans a longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy (Puestow procedure).  

Which of the following best describes the key steps and principles of this operation?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **Puestow procedure**, or **longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy**, is designed to **decompress a dilated main pancreatic duct** by creating a **longitudinal anastomosis** between the duct and a **Roux-en-Y limb of jejunum**, providing drainage of the entire pancreas from tail to head.

**1. Indications:**  
- Chronic pancreatitis with **dilated pancreatic duct (>6–7 mm)**.  
- Recurrent pain or ductal obstruction not amenable to endoscopic therapy.  
- Stones or strictures within the duct.  

**2. Operative steps:**  
1. **Incision:** A subcostal or midline incision is made.  
2. **Exposure:** Enter the **lesser sac** by dividing the **gastrocolic ligament** and mobilizing the **splenic and hepatic flexures**. Perform a **Kocher maneuver** to expose the pancreatic head.  
3. **Identify and open the main pancreatic duct:**  
   - Palpate and confirm duct location by **needle aspiration** (clear fluid or stones).  
   - **Electrocautery** is used to open the duct **longitudinally** from near the **tail to the head**, including the **ducts of Wirsung and Santorini**.  
   - **Remove intraductal stones** if present.  
4. **Construct the Roux-en-Y limb:** Bring the jejunal limb **retrocolic** through a mesenteric window.  
5. **Anastomosis:**  
   - Perform a **side-to-side mucosa-to-mucosa pancreaticojejunostomy**, aligning the jejunal enterotomy with the opened duct.  
   - Use **interrupted or continuous absorbable sutures**.  
   - Ensure complete decompression proximally and distally before closure.  
6. **Closure:** Complete the Roux-en-Y reconstruction and close the abdomen.  

**3. Key technical points:**  
- The **duct must be opened fully to the head**, where it runs more posteriorly, for effective drainage and pain relief.  
- **Inadequate ductal exposure** or incomplete opening leads to **persistent pain or recurrence**.  
- The **Frey modification** involves coring out part of the pancreatic head if exposure is limited.  

| Step | Description | Key Purpose |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Exposure** | Mobilize stomach, colon, and duodenum | Access pancreas |
| **Ductotomy** | Open duct tail → head | Complete decompression |
| **Roux limb** | Brought retrocolic | Prevent bile reflux |
| **Anastomosis** | Pancreas to jejunum | Longitudinal drainage |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Total resection is unnecessary and increases morbidity.  
- **C:** Limited drainage fails to decompress the head.  
- **D:** Percutaneous drainage is temporary and inadequate.  
- **E:** Short-limb anastomosis to the tail only does not relieve ductal hypertension.  

**Key takeaway:** The **Puestow procedure** decompresses the entire pancreatic duct through a **longitudinal ductotomy and Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy**, ensuring **complete drainage** from tail to head and long-term pain relief.

Correct answer: A — Longitudinal opening of the main pancreatic duct from tail to head with Roux-en-Y pancreaticojejunostomy to ensure full drainage.
