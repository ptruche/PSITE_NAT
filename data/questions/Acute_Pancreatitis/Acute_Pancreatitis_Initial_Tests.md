A 9-year-old girl presents with acute onset of severe upper abdominal pain radiating to the back, nausea, and vomiting. She has no history of trauma or medication use. On exam, she has moderate epigastric tenderness without peritonitis. Vital signs show mild tachycardia and dehydration. Laboratory results reveal normal electrolytes and hemoglobin. The emergency physician suspects acute pancreatitis. 

Which combination of initial laboratory studies is most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying etiology?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **diagnostic cornerstone** of acute pancreatitis is **serum lipase and amylase**, with additional labs to assess severity and determine etiology.

**1. Diagnostic enzymes:**  
- **Serum lipase**: Most specific; rises within 4–8 hours, peaks at 24 hours, remains elevated for 8–14 days.  
- **Serum amylase**: Less specific; rises faster (2–12 hours) but normalizes within 3–5 days. Up to **20%** of patients may have normal amylase at presentation.  
- *Amylase isoenzymes* may help differentiate salivary from pancreatic sources of elevation.

**2. Etiologic evaluation:**  
- **Liver function tests (AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin):** Identify biliary obstruction or choledocholithiasis.  
- **Serum triglycerides:** Identify hypertriglyceridemia-induced pancreatitis (>1000 mg/dL).  

**3. Severity assessment and resuscitation markers:**  
CBC, BUN, calcium, albumin, and LDH at admission and 48 hours can predict disease severity and guide fluid therapy.

| Test | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Lipase, amylase** | Confirm diagnosis |
| **LFTs** | Detect biliary obstruction (ALT >150 IU/L → high likelihood of gallstone etiology) |
| **Triglycerides** | Diagnose hyperlipidemic pancreatitis |
| **Calcium, albumin, BUN** | Severity assessment |
| **CBC** | Detect hemoconcentration, inflammation |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Coagulation and urinalysis are nonspecific.  
- **C:** Stool elastase and sweat chloride assess exocrine or CF-related insufficiency, not acute inflammation.  
- **D:** Calcium and CRP may reflect severity but not etiology; ANA is unrelated.  
- **E:** Lactic acidosis or infection markers do not confirm pancreatitis.  

**Key takeaway:** The **initial diagnostic panel** for suspected acute pancreatitis includes **serum lipase, amylase, liver function tests, and triglycerides**, with serial monitoring of metabolic parameters to guide management.

Correct answer: A — Serum lipase, amylase, liver function tests, and triglycerides confirm diagnosis and help determine etiology.
