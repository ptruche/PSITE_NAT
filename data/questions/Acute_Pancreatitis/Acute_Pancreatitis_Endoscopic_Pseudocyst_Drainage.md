A: Endoscopic cystogastrostomy with electrocautery creation of a tract and stent placement after confirming pseudocyst location
B: Immediate percutaneous drainage for all pseudocysts regardless of wall maturity or infection status
C: Open surgical cystgastrostomy as first-line therapy for all pseudocysts
D: Endoscopic drainage through the duodenum for all pancreatic pseudocysts, regardless of location
E: Observation only, as pseudocysts never require endoscopic or surgical intervention
correct: A

A 12-year-old boy presents with a symptomatic pseudocyst four weeks after traumatic pancreatitis. CT imaging shows a 6 cm well-circumscribed pseudocyst compressing the posterior wall of the stomach. Endoscopic drainage is planned.  

Which of the following best describes the appropriate **technique and indications** for endoscopic drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Endoscopic drainage** has become a preferred **minimally invasive** approach for managing **mature, symptomatic pancreatic pseudocysts**, particularly when the cyst is **adjacent to the stomach or duodenum**.  

**1. Indications and success factors:**  
- Best suited for **mature pseudocysts** (>4–6 weeks old) with a **well-formed wall** <1 cm thick.  
- Works well for **lesser sac pseudocysts** bulging into the stomach (**cystogastrostomy**) or **head pseudocysts** (**cystoduodenostomy**).  
- More effective for **traumatic** pseudocysts than for non-traumatic ones.  
- Less successful if the pseudocyst is **infected** or associated with **pancreatic necrosis**.  

**2. Technique of endoscopic cystogastrostomy:**  
1. **Endoscope introduced into the stomach.**  
2. Identify **indentation of the gastric wall** corresponding to cyst location.  
3. Confirm location via **endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)** or **needle aspiration**.  
4. Use **electrocautery** to create a **common channel** between stomach and cyst.  
5. Advance a **guidewire**, then **dilate the tract** with a sphincterotome or balloon.  
6. Place one or more **stents** for continuous drainage into the stomach.  

**3. Outcomes and alternatives:**  
- **Sharma et al.** reported **100% success** in children (mostly traumatic pseudocysts).  
- **Non-traumatic pseudocysts** have lower success rates and may require repeat or open procedures.  
- Compared to open drainage, **endoscopic drainage** offers **shorter hospital stays**, **fewer short-term complications**, and **better early quality of life**, though **long-term outcomes remain uncertain**.  

| Approach | Indications | Key Points |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Endoscopic drainage** | Mature, symptomatic pseudocyst near GI lumen | Preferred; minimally invasive |
| **Percutaneous drainage** | Acute pseudocyst needing urgent decompression | Higher risk of fistula |
| **Surgical drainage** | Recurrent, multiple, or suspicious for malignancy | Definitive but more invasive |

**Key takeaway:** **Endoscopic cystogastrostomy** involves **creating a tract with electrocautery and stenting** between the stomach and a mature pseudocyst, offering high success rates in pediatric traumatic cases.

Correct answer: A — Endoscopic cystogastrostomy with electrocautery creation of a tract and stent placement after confirming pseudocyst location.
