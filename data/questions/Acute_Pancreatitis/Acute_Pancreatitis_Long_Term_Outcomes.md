A: The long-term prognosis depends on etiology and severity, with structural, genetic, or metabolic causes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis and severe disease linked to higher morbidity and mortality
B: All children with acute pancreatitis eventually recover fully without long-term complications if supportive care is adequate
C: Traumatic and biliary pancreatitis carry the highest risk of recurrence and chronic inflammation due to persistent ductal injury
D: Mortality in pediatric severe acute pancreatitis exceeds 15%, with pseudocysts being the leading cause of death
E: Idiopathic and toxin-related pancreatitis have the lowest recurrence and rarely progress to chronic disease
correct: A

A 9-year-old boy presents with recurrent abdominal pain three months after an admission for acute pancreatitis. His initial episode was mild and attributed to an unrecognized structural anomaly at the pancreaticobiliary junction. His laboratory workup and imaging now demonstrate early features of chronic pancreatitis.  

Which of the following best describes the long-term outcomes and prognostic patterns after acute pancreatitis in children?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

The **long-term outcome of acute pancreatitis** in children depends primarily on its **etiology** and **severity at presentation**. While many recover completely, specific subgroups have higher risks for **recurrent or chronic pancreatitis** and **complications**.

**1. Outcomes by etiology:**  
- **Trauma:** Usually resolves without long-term issues once short-term complications (e.g., pseudocyst) are managed.  
- **Choledocholithiasis:** Excellent prognosis if **ductal obstruction is relieved** and **cholecystectomy performed**.  
- **Structural anomalies** (e.g., annular pancreas, pancreaticobiliary malunion): Often lead to **recurrent or chronic pancreatitis** unless corrected surgically.  
- **Toxin/drug-induced:** Recovery is typical if the **offending agent is discontinued**.  
- **Idiopathic, genetic, or metabolic** (e.g., PRSS1, CFTR, SPINK1 mutations): Highest likelihood of **progression to chronic pancreatitis**.  

**2. Outcomes by severity:**  
- **Mild pancreatitis:** Typically resolves without sequelae.  
- **Severe pancreatitis:** Associated with significant short-term morbidity and some risk of mortality.  
  - Mortality: **2–4% in children.**  
  - Common complications:  
    | Complication | Incidence |
    |---------------|------------|
    | Acute fluid collections | 28% |
    | Pancreatic pseudocysts | 10–38% |
    | Pancreatic ascites | 3% |
    | Acute lung injury | 4–12% |
    | Acute kidney injury | 3–11% |
    | Multiorgan dysfunction | 3–4% |
    | GI bleeding | 1% |
  - **29%** require ICU care; **7%** require pancreatic procedures.

**3. Recurrence and chronicity:**  
- **Recurrent pancreatitis:** Occurs in **15–33%** of pediatric cases.  
- If not investigated and treated (especially for structural or genetic causes), this may evolve into **chronic pancreatitis** with permanent exocrine or endocrine insufficiency.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Not all recover fully; chronic or recurrent disease occurs in specific etiologies.  
- **C:** Traumatic and biliary forms usually resolve completely when treated.  
- **D:** Mortality <5%; pseudocysts are not the cause of death.  
- **E:** Idiopathic and toxin-related forms often have higher recurrence risk, not lower.

**Key takeaway:** The **prognosis of acute pancreatitis** in children is excellent for **traumatic and biliary causes**, but **genetic, metabolic, and structural etiologies** predispose to **recurrent or chronic disease**. **Severity** correlates with **short-term morbidity and mortality**, not necessarily chronicity.

Correct answer: A — The long-term prognosis depends on etiology and severity, with structural, genetic, or metabolic causes predisposing to chronic pancreatitis and severe disease linked to higher morbidity and mortality.
