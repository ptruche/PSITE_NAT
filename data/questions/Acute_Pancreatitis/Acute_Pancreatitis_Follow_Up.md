A: Patients recovering from severe pancreatitis require close follow-up for resolution of collections and early detection of insufficiency; mild cases need etiology evaluation to prevent recurrence
B: Routine follow-up is unnecessary once symptoms resolve, as long-term complications are rare in children
C: Only patients with pseudocyst drainage require imaging surveillance; laboratory testing is not recommended post-recovery
D: Long-term follow-up should focus solely on exocrine function testing, as endocrine issues do not occur after pediatric pancreatitis
E: After resolution, annual imaging for five years is required to monitor for pancreatic malignancy
correct: A

A 10-year-old boy recovers from severe acute pancreatitis complicated by a pancreatic pseudocyst. He is discharged after complete resolution of symptoms. You are planning his outpatient follow-up.  

Which of the following best describes the appropriate follow-up strategy after recovery from pancreatitis in pediatric patients?  

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Follow-up after pancreatitis** depends on **severity of the initial presentation** and the **underlying cause**.  
Children recovering from **severe or complicated pancreatitis** require **close monitoring** for residual complications and functional sequelae, whereas **mild cases** primarily need **etiologic evaluation** to prevent recurrence.

**1. Severe or complicated pancreatitis:**  
- Requires **regular clinical and imaging follow-up** until resolution of acute complications:  
  - **Acute fluid collections**  
  - **Pancreatic pseudocysts**  
  - **Pancreatic ascites**  
- **Endocrine or exocrine insufficiency** occurs in approximately **1%**, typically after **significant necrosis**.  
- **Imaging:** For pseudocysts, perform **ultrasound or MRI every six months** until resolution.  

**2. Mild pancreatitis:**  
- Routine close follow-up is **not necessary**, but identifying the **etiology** is critical to prevent recurrence or chronic disease.  
- **Investigations may include:**  
  - CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel, **liver function tests**  
  - **Lipase, glucose, calcium, triglycerides**  
  - **Toxicology screen** for medication or toxin-related cases  
  - **Ultrasound** for biliary pathology  
  - **Genetic and metabolic screening** (e.g., CFTR, PRSS1, SPINK1, serum ammonia, urine organic acids)  
  - **Celiac testing** or **stool ova and parasite studies**, depending on presentation.

| Follow-up Type | Indicated For | Components |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Close follow-up (imaging + labs)** | Severe pancreatitis, pseudocyst, necrosis | Serial imaging, endocrine/exocrine evaluation |
| **Etiologic work-up** | Recurrent or idiopathic pancreatitis | Genetic, metabolic, anatomic evaluation |
| **Routine follow-up** | Mild pancreatitis | Clinical recovery assessment only |

**3. Goal of follow-up:**  
- Ensure **resolution of acute pathology**.  
- Detect **functional insufficiency** early.  
- Prevent **chronic pancreatitis** by addressing the underlying cause.

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** Ongoing issues can arise; surveillance is important for severe disease.  
- **C:** Lab evaluation is crucial for identifying recurrent or idiopathic causes.  
- **D:** Both endocrine and exocrine insufficiency can occur after necrosis.  
- **E:** Pediatric pancreatitis is not linked to malignancy; long-term imaging is unnecessary.

**Key takeaway:**  
After **severe pancreatitis**, patients require **ongoing follow-up** with labs and imaging to confirm resolution and detect insufficiency, while **mild cases** require **etiologic workup** to prevent recurrence and chronic progression.

Correct answer: A — Patients recovering from severe pancreatitis require close follow-up for resolution of collections and early detection of insufficiency; mild cases need etiology evaluation to prevent recurrence.
