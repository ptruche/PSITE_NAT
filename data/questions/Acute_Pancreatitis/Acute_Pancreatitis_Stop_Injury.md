id: PANCREATITIS-015
A: Perform ERCP to remove a common bile duct stone causing obstruction
B: Schedule elective MRCP after resolution of symptoms to confirm diagnosis
C: Begin empiric antibiotics and observe for spontaneous passage of stones
D: Perform endoscopic ultrasound to evaluate for pseudocyst formation
E: Delay intervention for two weeks to allow inflammation to subside before addressing obstruction
correct: A

A 12-year-old girl presents with acute pancreatitis and jaundice. Laboratory studies reveal elevated lipase, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, and markedly increased alkaline phosphatase. Ultrasound demonstrates a dilated common bile duct with a 6 mm stone at the ampulla. She continues to have worsening pain and persistent vomiting despite fluid resuscitation and bowel rest. 

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

In cases of **acute pancreatitis secondary to mechanical obstruction**, the priority is to **remove the obstructing source** and **restore pancreatic drainage** to prevent continued injury.

**1. Identifying the obstruction:**  
- **MRCP** is a **noninvasive** imaging study to delineate anatomy and confirm the presence of a stone, stricture, or mass.  
- Used when the diagnosis is uncertain or when ultrasound does not clearly identify the obstruction.

**2. Definitive intervention:**  
- **ERCP** (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) is the **therapeutic procedure of choice** when there is a **known obstructing lesion** (e.g., stone, stricture, or tumor).  
- It allows:  
  - **Stone extraction** from the common bile or pancreatic duct  
  - **Stent placement or dilation** of strictures  
  - **Biopsy** of suspected masses  
  - **Direct visualization** of ductal anatomy  

**3. Timing considerations:**  
- ERCP should be performed **urgently** when obstruction or cholangitis is suspected.  
- Diagnostic ERCP is **not indicated** in uncomplicated pancreatitis without evidence of obstruction.  
- MRCP or endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) can be used **after recovery** to evaluate for structural causes if no obstruction is seen.

| Modality | Role | Indication |
|-----------|------|------------|
| **MRCP** | Noninvasive delineation of anatomy | Recurrent or idiopathic pancreatitis |
| **ERCP** | Therapeutic removal of obstruction | Stone, stricture, or mass causing pancreatitis |
| **EUS** | Diagnostic adjunct | When MRCP is inconclusive or biopsy needed |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** MRCP is diagnostic, not therapeutic; ERCP is needed for removal.  
- **C:** Antibiotics are not indicated unless infection (e.g., cholangitis) is present.  
- **D:** Pseudocyst evaluation is not relevant in early obstruction.  
- **E:** Delay risks worsening pancreatitis and sepsis from persistent obstruction.  

**Key takeaway:** When **obstructive pancreatitis** is confirmed or strongly suspected, **ERCP** should be performed promptly to **remove the obstruction** and **stop ongoing pancreatic injury**.

Correct answer: A — ERCP removes obstructing stones and restores drainage, preventing further pancreatic injury.
