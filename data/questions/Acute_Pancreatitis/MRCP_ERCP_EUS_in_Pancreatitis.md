A: MRCP as first-line imaging to identify structural or ductal anomalies in recurrent pancreatitis
B: ERCP as first-line diagnostic test for all patients with suspected biliary pancreatitis
C: CT with IV contrast to evaluate for pancreatic divisum and choledocholithiasis
D: Endoscopic ultrasound as preferred noninvasive alternative to MRCP in children
E: MRCP reserved for cases where CT shows pancreatic necrosis
correct: A

A 10-year-old boy presents with his third episode of pancreatitis in 18 months. He has no trauma, metabolic disorder, or medication history. Ultrasound shows a mildly dilated common bile duct but no stones. The gastroenterology team is consulted to evaluate for a structural cause of his recurrent pancreatitis. 

Which of the following is the most appropriate next diagnostic study?

<!-- EXPLANATION -->

**Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)** is the **noninvasive imaging modality of choice** for evaluating **recurrent pancreatitis** or **suspected biliary obstruction** when ultrasound findings are inconclusive. It provides high-resolution visualization of the **biliary and pancreatic ducts** without the use of radiation or iodinated contrast.

**Key diagnostic roles of MRCP:**  
- Evaluates **ductal anomalies** (e.g., pancreatic divisum, choledochal cyst, pancreaticobiliary malunion).  
- Detects **stones, strictures, or tumors** in the biliary system.  
- Sensitivity for CBD visualization: **96%**; CBD stones: **71–100%**; small ducts: **~80%**.  
- **Secretin-enhanced MRCP** transiently increases ductal pressure, improving visualization of the **minor papilla** and **pancreatic divisum**—though its pediatric utility remains unclear.

**Advantages over CT and ERCP:**  
- **No radiation or iodinated contrast** exposure.  
- **Noninvasive**, unlike ERCP, which carries a **5–10% risk of postprocedure pancreatitis**.  
- **Comparable or superior ductal visualization** to CT in most cases.

**ERCP:**  
- Reserved for **therapeutic or complex diagnostic** indications:  
  - Duct disruption (trauma → stent placement)  
  - Pancreatitis with **cholangitis or choledocholithiasis** not visualized on MRCP  
  - Detailed ductal anatomy when MRCP is inconclusive  

**Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS):**  
- Allows for **direct visualization and biopsy**, but is **invasive** and requires **sedation**.  
- Used increasingly in pediatric centers for indeterminate lesions or to complement MRCP.

| Modality | Use | Key Advantages | Limitations |
|-----------|-----|----------------|--------------|
| **US** | First-line for gallstones | Noninvasive, no radiation | Limited by bowel gas |
| **MRCP** | Best for ductal anatomy, structural causes | No radiation, high sensitivity | Sedation may be needed |
| **CT** | Complications, trauma, necrosis | Widely available | Radiation exposure |
| **ERCP** | Therapeutic (stones, leaks) | Allows intervention | Invasive, 5–10% pancreatitis risk |
| **EUS** | Lesion biopsy, fine detail | Diagnostic precision | Requires sedation |

**Why others are wrong:**  
- **B:** ERCP is not first-line and carries procedural risk.  
- **C:** CT cannot reliably diagnose ductal anomalies.  
- **D:** EUS is invasive and not first-line in children.  
- **E:** MRCP is used before CT or ERCP in most cases.  

**Key takeaway:** **MRCP** is the **preferred noninvasive imaging study** for children with **recurrent or idiopathic pancreatitis**, allowing detailed evaluation of biliary and pancreatic ductal anatomy without radiation.

Correct answer: A — MRCP is first-line for evaluating structural or ductal causes of recurrent pancreatitis in children.
